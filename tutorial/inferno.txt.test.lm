" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , "

so shouted his fierce lips , which <unk> <unk>

became not ; and my guide address'd him thus :

" o <unk> spirit ! let thy horn for thee

<unk> : <unk> <unk> thy rage , if rage

or other <unk> <unk> thee . search thy neck ,

there shalt thou find the <unk> that <unk> it on .

wild spirit ! lo , upon thy mighty breast

where hangs the <unk> ! " then to me he spake :

" he doth <unk> himself . <unk> is this ,

through whose ill counsel in the world no more

one tongue <unk> . but pass we on , nor waste

our words ; for so each language is to him ,

as his to others , understood by none . "

then to the leftward turning sped we forth ,

and at a <unk> <unk> found another shade

far <unk> and more huge . i <unk> say

what master hand had <unk> him ; but he held

behind the right arm <unk> , and before

the other with a <unk> , that <unk> him

from the neck down , and five times round his form

<unk> met the <unk> <unk> . " this proud one

would of his strength against almighty <unk>

make trial , " said my guide ; " whence he is thus

<unk> : <unk> him they call .

" great was his <unk> , when the <unk> brought

fear on the <unk> : those arms , which then he <unk> ,

now moves he never . " forthwith i return'd :

" fain would i , if 't were <unk> , mine eyes

of <unk> <unk> gain'd

<unk> next . " he answer'd : " thou shalt see

not far from hence <unk> , who both <unk>

and is <unk> , who shall place us there

where guilt is at its depth . far onward stands

whom thou wouldst fain behold , in <unk> , and made

like to this spirit , save that in his looks

more fell he seems . " by violent <unk> <unk>

ne'er shook a <unk> , so <unk> to its base ,

as <unk> . more than ever then

i <unk> death , nor than the terror more

had <unk> , if i had not seen the <unk>

that held him fast . we , straightway journeying on ,

came to <unk> , who five <unk> <unk>

without the head , forth issued from the <unk> .

" o thou , who in the <unk> vale , that made

great <unk> <unk> of glory , when his <unk>

drove back the troop of <unk> in flight ,

who thence of old didst carry for thy <unk>

an hundred <unk> ; and if thou <unk> fought

in the high <unk> on thy <unk> side ,

seems as men yet believ'd , that through thine arm

the <unk> of earth had <unk> , now vouchsafe

to place us down beneath , where <unk> <unk>

locks up <unk> . force not that we <unk>

or <unk> help or <unk> . here is one

can give what in this realm ye <unk> . <unk>

therefore , nor <unk> <unk> thy lip .

he in the upper world can yet <unk>

renown on thee , for he doth live , and looks

for life yet longer , if before the time

<unk> call him not unto herself . " thus spake

the teacher . he in haste forth stretch'd his hands ,

and caught my guide . <unk> <unk> felt

that grapple <unk> <unk> . soon as my guide

had felt it , he bespake me thus : " this way

that i may <unk> thee ; " then so caught me up ,

that we were both one burden . as <unk>

the <unk> of <unk> , from beneath

where it doth <unk> , if chance a passing cloud

so <unk> across , that opposite it hangs ,

such then <unk> seem'd , as at mine <unk>

i mark'd him <unk> . i were fain at times

t' have pass'd another way . yet in th' abyss ,

that <unk> with <unk> low <unk> ,

<unk> he plac'd us ; nor there leaning <unk> ,

but rose as in a bark the <unk> <unk> .

could i command rough <unk> and hoarse , to <unk>

that <unk> of sorrow , o'er which <unk> rock

his firm <unk> <unk> , then might the vein

of <unk> rise full <unk> : but not mine

such <unk> , and with <unk> <unk> i touch

the mighty theme ; for to <unk> the depth

of all the universe , is no <unk>

to <unk> with , and <unk> a tongue not us'd

to infant <unk> . but let them <unk>

my song , the tuneful <unk> , by whose aid

<unk> <unk> in thebes , so with the truth

my speech shall best <unk> . oh ill - <unk> <unk> ,

beyond all others wretched ! who abide

in such a <unk> , as scarce thought <unk> words

to speak of , better had ye here on earth

been <unk> or mountain <unk> . as down we stood

in the dark <unk> beneath the <unk> feet ,

but lower far than they , and i did gaze

still on the lofty <unk> , a voice

<unk> me thus : " look how thou <unk> . take

good heed , thy <unk> do tread not on the heads

of thy <unk> <unk> . " <unk> i turn'd ,

and saw before and underneath my feet

a lake , whose <unk> surface <unk> seem'd

to <unk> than water . not so thick a <unk>

in <unk> e'er hath <unk> <unk> spread

o'er his still course , nor <unk> far remote

under the <unk> sky . roll'd o'er that mass

had <unk> or <unk> fall'n ,

not e'en its <unk> had <unk> . as <unk> the frog

<unk> above the wave , what time in <unk>

the <unk> <unk> oft <unk> her toil ,

so , to where <unk> shame <unk> , thus low

<unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> the spirits stood ,

moving their teeth in shrill note like the <unk> .

his face each downward held ; their mouth the <unk> ,

their eyes <unk> the <unk> of their heart .

a space i look'd around , then at my feet

saw two so <unk> join'd , that of their head

the <unk> <unk> were <unk> . " tell me ye ,

whose <unk> thus together <unk> , " said i ,

" who are ye ? " at that sound their <unk> they bent ,

and when their looks were lifted up to me ,

straightway their eyes , before all <unk> within ,

<unk> upon their lips , and the <unk> bound

the tears betwixt those <unk> and held them there .

<unk> unto <unk> hath never <unk> clos'd up

so <unk> . whence like two <unk> <unk>

they <unk> together ; them such fury seiz'd .

and one , from whom the <unk> both ears had reft ,

exclaim'd , still looking downward : " why on us

dost <unk> so long ? if thou wouldst know

who are these two , the valley , whence his wave

<unk> <unk> , did for its master own

their sire <unk> , and next him themselves .

they from one body issued ; and throughout

<unk> thou mayst search , nor find a shade

more worthy in <unk> to be fix'd ,

not him , whose breast and <unk> <unk> land

at that one blow <unk> , not <unk> ,

no not this spirit , whose <unk> head

<unk> my onward view : he bore the name

of <unk> : tuscan if thou be ,

well knowest who he was : and to <unk> short

all further question , in my form behold

what once was <unk> . i <unk>

<unk> here my <unk> , whose deep guilt

shall <unk> out mine . " a thousand <unk>

then mark'd i , which the keen and eager <unk>

had shap'd into a <unk> <unk> ; whence <unk>

a <unk> horror o'er me , at the thought

of those <unk> <unk> . while we journey'd on

toward the middle , at whose point <unk>

all heavy substance , and i trembling went

through that eternal <unk> , i know not

if will it were or destiny , or chance ,

but , passing 'midst the heads , my foot did strike

with violent blow against the face of one .

" wherefore dost <unk> me ? " weeping , he exclaim'd ,

" unless thy <unk> be some fresh revenge

for <unk> , wherefore <unk> me ? "

i thus : " instructor , now <unk> me here ,

that i through him may <unk> me of my doubt .

<unk> what haste thou <unk> . " the teacher paus'd ,

and to that shade i spake , who <unk>

still curs'd me in his wrath . " what art thou , speak ,

that <unk> thus on others ? " he replied :

" now who art thou , that <unk> <unk> cheeks

through <unk> <unk> , with such force

as were past <unk> , <unk> thou living still ? "

" and i am living , to thy joy perchance , "

was my reply , " if fame be <unk> to thee ,

that with the rest i may thy name <unk> . "

" the <unk> of what i <unk> most , "

said he , " thou <unk> : hence ; nor <unk> me more .

ill knowest thou to <unk> in this vale . "

then <unk> on his hinder <unk> , i cried :

" name thee , or not a hair shall tarry here . "

" rend all away , " he answer'd , " yet for that

i will not tell nor <unk> thee who i am ,

though at my head thou <unk> a thousand times . "

now i had grasp'd his tresses , and <unk> off

more than one <unk> , he <unk> , with his eyes

drawn in and downward , when another cried ,

" what <unk> thee , <unk> ? sound not loud enough

thy <unk> teeth , but thou must bark <unk> ?

what devil <unk> thee ? " -- " now , " said i , " be <unk> ,

accursed <unk> ! to thy shame of thee

true <unk> will i bear . " -- " off , " he replied ,

" tell what thou <unk> ; but as thou escape from hence

to speak of him whose tongue hath been so <unk> ,

<unk> not : here he <unk> the <unk> gold .

<unk> of <unk> , ' thou canst say , <unk> mark'd ,

where the <unk> sinners <unk> . ' if thou be ask'd

what other shade was with them , at thy side

is <unk> , whose red <unk> <unk>

the <unk> <unk> of florence . farther on ,

if i <unk> not , <unk> <unk> ,

with <unk> , and <unk> , him

who <unk> <unk> when the people <unk> . "

we now had left him , passing on our way ,

when i beheld two spirits by the <unk>

<unk> in one hollow , that the head of one

was <unk> unto the other ; and as <unk>

is <unk> up through hunger , th' <unk>

did so <unk> his fangs to th' other's brain ,

where the <unk> joins it . not more <unk>

on <unk> temples <unk> <unk> ,

than on that <unk> and on its <unk> he .

" o thou who <unk> so <unk> sign of <unk>

'gainst him thou <unk> on , let me hear , " said i

" the cause , on such <unk> , that if right

<unk> thy <unk> , <unk> who ye are ,

and what the colour of his <unk> was ,

i may <unk> thee in the world above ,

if that , wherewith i speak be <unk> so long . "

his jaws <unk> from their fell <unk> ,

that sinner <unk> them on the <unk> <unk> th' head ,

which he behind had <unk> , then began :

" thy will <unk> , i call up <unk>

sorrow past cure , which but to think of <unk>

my heart , or ere i tell <unk> . but if words ,

that i may utter , shall <unk> seed to bear

fruit of eternal infamy to him ,

the <unk> whom i <unk> at , thou at once

shalt see me speak and <unk> . who thou mayst be

i know not , nor how here below art come :

but <unk> thou <unk> of a truth ,

when i do hear thee . know i was on earth

<unk> <unk> , and th' <unk> he

<unk> . why i neighbour him so close ,

now <unk> . that through effect of his ill thoughts

in him my trust <unk> , i was <unk>

and after <unk> , need is not i tell .

what therefore thou canst not have heard , that is ,

how cruel was the <unk> , shalt thou hear ,

and know if he have <unk> me . a small <unk>

within that <unk> , which for my sake the name

of <unk> bears , where others yet must <unk> ,

already through its opening <unk> <unk>

had shown me , when i <unk> the evil sleep ,

that from the future tore the <unk> off .

this one , methought , as master of the sport ,

<unk> forth to chase the <unk> wolf and his <unk>

unto the mountain , which <unk> the sight

of <unk> to the <unk> . with <unk> <unk>

<unk> and keen , before him <unk>

<unk> with <unk> and <unk> .

after short course the father and the <unk>

seem'd <unk> and <unk> , and methought i saw

the sharp <unk> <unk> their sides . when i <unk>

before the dawn , amid their sleep i heard

my <unk> ( for they were with me ) <unk> and ask

for <unk> . right cruel art thou , if no pang

thou feel at <unk> what my heart <unk> ;

and if not now , why use thy tears to <unk> ?

now had they <unk> ; and the hour drew near

when they were wont to bring us food ; the mind

of each <unk> him through his <unk> , and i

heard , at its <unk> underneath <unk> up

the' horrible <unk> : whence <unk> not a word

i look'd upon the visage of my <unk> .

i wept not : so all stone i felt within .

they wept : and one , my little <unk> , cried :

" thou <unk> so ! father what <unk> thee ? " yet

i <unk> no tear , nor answer'd all that day

nor the next night , until another sun

came out upon the world . when a faint beam

had to our <unk> <unk> made its way ,

and in four <unk> i <unk>

the image of my own , on either hand

through agony i <unk> , and they who thought

i did it through desire of feeding , rose

<unk> th' sudden , and cried , <unk> , we should <unk>

far less , if thou wouldst <unk> of us : thou <unk>

these <unk> of miserable flesh we wear ,

<unk> do thou <unk> them off from us again . '

then , not to make them <unk> , i kept down

my spirit in <unk> . that day and the next

we all were silent . ah , <unk> earth !

why <unk> not upon us ? when we came

to the fourth day , then <unk> at my feet

outstretch'd did <unk> him , <unk> , <unk> no help

for me , my father ! ' there he <unk> , and e'en

<unk> as thou seest me , saw i the three

fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth :

" whence i <unk> me now <unk> blind to <unk>

over them all , and for three days aloud

call'd on them who were dead . then <unk> <unk>

the <unk> of grief . " thus having spoke ,

once more upon the wretched <unk> his teeth

he <unk> , like a <unk> 'gainst the bone

firm and <unk> . oh thou <unk> ! shame

of all the people , who their dwelling make

in that fair region , where th' <unk> voice

is heard , since that thy <unk> are so <unk>

to <unk> , from their deep <unk> rise

<unk> and <unk> , and <unk> up

the mouth of <unk> , that each soul in thee

may <unk> in the waters ! what if fame

<unk> that thy <unk> were <unk>

by <unk> , yet no right <unk> thou

to <unk> his <unk> on the <unk> . for them ,

<unk> , <unk> , and the <unk>

of gentle <unk> , of whom my song hath told ,

their <unk> years , thou <unk> thebes ! did make

<unk> of guilt . onward we pass'd ,

where others <unk> in rugged <unk> of <unk>

not on their feet were turn'd , but each revers'd .

there <unk> weeping <unk> not to <unk> ;

for at their eyes grief <unk> passage <unk>

<unk> , and <unk> inward turns

for <unk> of sharp anguish : the first tears

<unk> <unk> , and like <unk> <unk> <unk> ,

under the <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .

now though the <unk> had from my face <unk>

each <unk> , as 't were <unk> , yet me seem'd

some breath of wind i felt . " whence <unk> this , "

said i , " my master ? is not here below

all vapour quench'd ? " -- " <unk> shalt be speedily , "

he answer'd , " where thine eye shall tell thee whence

the cause <unk> of this <unk> <unk> . "

then cried out one in the <unk> <unk> who mourn'd :

" o souls so cruel ! that the <unk> <unk>

hath been assign'd you , from this face <unk>

the <unk> <unk> , that i may <unk> the grief

<unk> at my heart , some little space

ere it <unk> again ! " i thus replied :

" say who thou wast , if thou wouldst have mine aid ;

and if i <unk> thee not , far down

as to the lowest <unk> may i descend ! "

" the friar <unk> , " <unk> he ,

" am i , who from the evil <unk> <unk>

its <unk> , and am here <unk> , the <unk>

more <unk> for my <unk> . " -- " <unk> ! " i exclaim'd ,

" art thou too dead ! " -- " how in the world aloft

it <unk> with my body , " answer'd he ,

" i am right <unk> . such <unk>

hath <unk> , that ofttimes the soul

<unk> hither , ere by <unk> <unk> .

and that thou mayst <unk> out more <unk>

the <unk> tear - <unk> that <unk> mine eyes ,

know that the soul , that moment she <unk> ,

as i did , <unk> her body to a fiend

who after moves and <unk> it at will ,

till all its time be <unk> ; headlong she

falls to this <unk> . and perchance above

doth yet appear the body of a <unk> ,

who here behind me <unk> . him thou know'st ,

if thou but newly art arriv'd below .

the years are many that have pass'd away ,

since to this <unk> <unk> <unk> came . "

" now , " answer'd i , " <unk> thou <unk> me ,

for <unk> <unk> never yet hath <unk> ,

but doth all <unk> <unk> of a man ,

<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on . "

he thus : " not yet unto that upper foss

by th' evil talons <unk> , where the pitch

<unk> <unk> , had <unk> <unk> reach'd ,

when this one left a demon in his <unk>

in his own body , and of one his <unk> ,

who with him <unk> wrought . but now <unk> forth

thy hand , and <unk> mine eyes . " i <unk> them not .

ill <unk> were best courtesy to him .

ah <unk> ! men <unk> in every way ,

with every <unk> stain'd , why from the earth

are ye not <unk> ? such an one of yours

i with <unk> <unk> spirit found ,

as for his <unk> even now in soul

is in <unk> <unk> , and yet doth seem

in body still alive upon the earth .

" the <unk> of <unk> monarch do come forth

towards us ; therefore look , " so spake my guide ,

" if thou discern him . " as , when <unk> a cloud

heavy and <unk> , or when the shades of night

fall on our hemisphere , seems view'd from far

a <unk> , which the blast <unk> <unk> round ,

such was the <unk> then methought i saw ,

to <unk> me from the wind , forthwith i drew

behind my guide : no <unk> else was there .

now came i ( and with fear i bid my strain

record the <unk> ) where the souls were all

whelm'd underneath , <unk> , as through <unk>

<unk> the <unk> <unk> . some prone were laid ,

others stood upright , this upon the <unk> ,

that on his head , a third with face to feet

<unk> like a bow . when to the point we came ,

whereat my guide was pleas'd that i should see

the <unk> eminent in <unk> once ,

he from before me <unk> and made me pause .

" lo ! " he exclaim'd , " lo dis ! and lo the place ,

where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength . "

how <unk> and how faint i then became ,

ask me not , reader ! for i <unk> it not ,

since words would <unk> to tell thee of my state .

i was not dead nor living . think thyself

if quick <unk> work in thee at all ,

how i did feel . that <unk> , who <unk>

the realm of sorrow , at <unk> breast from th' <unk>

stood forth ; and i in <unk> am more like

a <unk> , than the <unk> are in his arms .

mark now how great that whole must be , which suits

with such a part . if he were <unk>

as he is hideous now , and yet did <unk>

to <unk> upon his <unk> , well from him

may all our <unk> <unk> . oh what a sight !

how passing strange it seem'd , when i did spy

upon his head three faces : one in front

of hue vermilion , th' other two with this

midway each <unk> join'd and at the <unk> ;

the right 'twixt <unk> and <unk> seem'd : the left

to look on , such as come from whence old <unk>

<unk> to the <unk> . under each shot forth

two mighty wings , <unk> as became

a bird so vast . sails never such i saw

outstretch'd on the wide sea . no plumes had they ,

but were in <unk> like a <unk> , and these

he <unk> i' th' air , that from him issued still

three winds , wherewith <unk> to its depth

was <unk> . at six eyes he wept : the tears

<unk> three <unk> <unk> with bloody foam .

at every mouth his teeth a sinner <unk>

<unk> as with <unk> <unk> , so that three

were in this guise tormented . but far more

than from that <unk> , was the foremost <unk>

by the fierce <unk> , whence ofttimes the back

was <unk> of all its skin . " that upper spirit ,

who hath worse punishment , " so spake my guide ,

" is <unk> , he that hath his head within

and <unk> the feet without . of th' other two ,

whose heads are under , from the murky <unk>

who hangs , is <unk> : lo ! how he doth <unk>

and <unk> not ! th' other <unk> , that <unk>

so large of limb . but night now re - <unk> ,

and it is time for <unk> . all is seen . "

i <unk> him round the neck , for so he bade ;

and <unk> time and place , he , when the wings

enough were <unk> , caught fast the shaggy sides ,

and down from pile to pile descending <unk>

between the thick fell and the <unk> <unk> .

soon as he reach'd the point , whereat the <unk>

upon the <unk> of the <unk> turns ,

my leader there with pain and struggling hard

turn'd round his head , where his feet stood before ,

and grappled at the fell , as one who <unk> ,

that into hell methought we turn'd again .

" expect that by such <unk> as these , " thus spake

the teacher , <unk> like a man <unk> ,

" we must depart from evil so extreme . "

then at a rocky opening issued forth ,

and plac'd me on a brink to sit , next join'd

with <unk> step my side . i rais'd mine eyes ,

<unk> that i <unk> should see

where he was lately left , but saw him now

with legs held upward . let the <unk> sort ,

who see not what the point was i had pass'd ,

<unk> them if sore toil oppress'd me then .

" arise , " my master cried , " upon thy feet .

the way is long , and much <unk> the road ;

and now within one hour and <unk> of <unk>

the sun returns . " it was no <unk> - <unk>

lofty and <unk> wherein we stood ,

but <unk> <unk> where ill <unk> was

and <unk> <unk> of light . " ere from th' abyss

i sep'rate , " thus when risen i began ,

" my guide ! vouchsafe few words to set me <unk>

from <unk> <unk> . where is now the <unk> ?

how <unk> he in <unk> thus revers'd ?

and how from <unk> to <unk> in space so brief

hath the sun made his <unk> ? " he in few

thus answering spake : " thou <unk> thou art still

on th' other side the centre , where i grasp'd

th' <unk> <unk> , that <unk> through the world .

thou wast on th' other side , so long as i

descended ; when i turn'd , thou didst <unk>

that point , to which from <unk> part is dragg'd

all heavy substance . thou art now arriv'd

under the hemisphere <unk> to that ,

which the great <unk> doth <unk> ,

and underneath whose <unk> <unk>

the man , that was born <unk> , and so liv'd .

thy feet are planted on the <unk> <unk> ,

whose other aspect is <unk> . <unk>

here rises , when there <unk> sets : and he ,

whose shaggy pile was <unk> , yet <unk> fix'd ,

as at the first . on this part he fell down

from heav'n ; and th' earth , here <unk> before ,

through fear of him did <unk> her with the sea ,

and to our hemisphere retir'd . perchance

to shun him was the <unk> space left here

by what of firm land on this side <unk> ,

that sprang aloof . " there is a place beneath ,

from <unk> as distant , as <unk>

the <unk> tomb , discover'd not by sight ,

but by the sound of <unk> , that descends

this way along the hollow of a rock ,

which , as it winds with no <unk> course ,

the wave hath <unk> . by that <unk> way

my guide and i did enter , to return

to the fair world : and <unk> of <unk>

we <unk> , he first , i following his steps ,

till on our view the <unk> <unk> of heav'n

<unk> through a <unk> opening in the <unk> :

thus issuing we again beheld the stars .
