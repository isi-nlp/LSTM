no power can the <unk> <unk> ;

nor to <unk> and will at once <unk> ,

by <unk> <unk> <unk> . ' "

oh <unk> ! how i shook myself , when he

seiz'd me , and cried , " thou <unk> <unk> me not

a <unk> in <unk> so <unk> . "

to minos down he bore me , and the judge

<unk> <unk> times round his <unk> back the tail ,

which <unk> with excess of rage , he spake :

" this is a <unk> soul , that in the fire

must vanish . hence <unk> - doom'd i <unk>

a prey to <unk> sorrow in this <unk> . "

when he had thus <unk> his words , the flame

in <unk> parted , <unk> to and fro ,

and <unk> its sharp horn . we onward went ,

i and my leader , up along the rock ,

far as another arch , that <unk>

the foss , wherein the <unk> is <unk>

of those , who load them with committed sin .

who , e'en in words <unk> , might at full

tell of the wounds and blood that now i saw ,

though he <unk> oft the tale ? no tongue

so vast a theme could equal , speech and thought

both <unk> <unk> . if in one band

collected , stood the people all , who e'er

pour'd on <unk> happy soil their blood ,

<unk> by the <unk> , and in that long war

when of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> made

a pile so high , as <unk> <unk> <unk>

who <unk> not , with the multitude , that felt

the <unk> force of <unk> <unk> <unk> ,

and those the rest , whose bones are gather'd yet

at <unk> , there where <unk>

<unk> th' <unk> name , or where beyond

thy walls , o <unk> , without arms

the old <unk> <unk> ; and his limbs

one were to <unk> transpierc'd , another his

clean <unk> away ; a <unk> like this

were but a thing of nought , to the' hideous sight

of the <unk> chasm . a <unk> , that hath lost

its middle or side <unk> , <unk> not so wide ,

as one i mark'd , torn from the <unk> throughout

down to the hinder passage : 'twixt the legs

<unk> his <unk> hung , the <unk> lay

open to view , and wretched <unk> ,

that turns th' <unk> <unk> to <unk> .

<unk> eagerly i fix on him my gaze ,

he ey'd me , with his hands laid his breast bare ,

and cried ; " now mark how i do <unk> me ! lo !

" how is <unk> <unk> ! before me

walks <unk> weeping , from the <unk> his face

<unk> to the <unk> ; and the others all

whom here thou seest , while they liv'd , did <unk>

<unk> and <unk> , and therefore thus are rent .

a fiend is here behind , who with his <unk>

<unk> us thus <unk> , <unk> again

each of this <unk> , when we have <unk> round

the dismal way , for first our <unk> close

ere we <unk> before him . but say who

art thou , that standest <unk> on the rock ,

<unk> so <unk> to delay the pain

<unk> upon thy crimes ? " -- " him death not yet , "

my guide rejoin'd , " hath <unk> , nor sin

<unk> to torment ; but , that he may make

full trial of your state , i who am dead

must through the <unk> of hell , from orb to orb ,

<unk> him . trust my words , for they are true . "

more than a hundred spirits , when that they heard ,

stood in the foss to mark me , through <unk> ,

<unk> of their pangs . " thou , who perchance

shalt <unk> view the sun , this <unk> thou

bear to <unk> : bid him , if he wish not

here soon to follow me , that with good store

of food he arm him , lest <unk> <unk>

<unk> him a <unk> to <unk> power ,

no easy <unk> else . " with foot uprais'd

for <unk> , spake <unk> , on the ground

then fix'd it to depart . another shade ,

pierc'd in the throat , his nostrils <unk>

e'en from beneath the <unk> , and one ear

<unk> off , who with the rest through wonder stood

<unk> , before the rest advanc'd , and <unk>

his wind - <unk> , that without was all <unk>

with crimson stain . " o thou ! " said he , " whom sin

<unk> not , and whom erst ( unless too near

<unk> do <unk> me ) i aloft

have seen on latian ground , call thou to mind

<unk> of <unk> , if again

returning , thou <unk> the pleasant land

that from <unk> <unk> to <unk> ;

" and there instruct the twain , whom <unk> <unk>

her <unk> <unk> , guido and <unk> ,

that if 't is giv'n us here to scan <unk>

the future , they out of <unk> <unk>

shall be cast forth , and whelm'd under the waves

near to <unk> , through <unk>

of a fell <unk> . 'twixt the <unk> isle

and <unk> , ne'er hath <unk> seen

an injury so foul , by <unk> done

or <unk> crew of old . that one - ey'd <unk>

( whose realm there is a spirit here were fain

his eye had still <unk> sight of ) them shall bring

to <unk> with him , then so shape his end ,

that they shall need not 'gainst <unk> wind

<unk> up <unk> nor <unk> . " i answering thus :

" declare , as thou dost wish that i above

may carry <unk> of thee , who is he ,

in whom that sight doth <unk> such sad remembrance ? "

forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek - bone

of one , his <unk> - spirit , and his jaws

<unk> , cried : " lo ! this is he i <unk> of ;

he <unk> not for himself : the <unk> this

who <unk> the doubt in <unk> mind ,

<unk> that delay to men prepar'd

was ever <unk> . " oh how <unk>

methought was <unk> , from whose throat was <unk>

the tongue , which spake that <unk> word . then one

<unk> of each hand , <unk> in the gloom

the <unk> <unk> , that they with <unk> <unk>

<unk> his face , and cried : " <unk> thee

of <unk> , too , i who , alas ! exclaim'd ,

<unk> deed once done there is an end , ' that prov'd

a seed of sorrow to the tuscan race . "

i added : " ay , and death to thine own tribe . "

whence <unk> woe on woe he <unk> off ,

as one grief stung to <unk> . but i there

still <unk> to behold the troop , and saw

things , such as i may fear without more proof

to tell of , but that conscience makes me firm ,

the <unk> <unk> , who her strong breast - <unk>

<unk> on him , that feels no guilt within

and <unk> him on and fear not . without doubt

i saw , and yet it seems to pass before me ,

a <unk> trunk , that even as the rest

of the sad flock pac'd onward . by the hair

it bore the <unk> <unk> , <unk> - <unk>

pendent in hand , which look'd at us and said ,

" <unk> me ! " the spirit <unk> thus himself ,

and two there were in one , and one in two .

how that may be he <unk> who <unk> so .

when at the bridge's foot direct he stood ,

his arm aloft he rear'd , <unk> the head

full in our view , that nearer we might hear

the words , which thus it utter'd : " now behold

this <unk> torment , thou , who <unk> go'st

to spy the dead ; behold if any else

be terrible as this . and that on earth

thou mayst bear <unk> of me , know that i

am <unk> , he of born , who gave king <unk>

the counsel <unk> . father and son

i set at <unk> war . for <unk>

and <unk> more did not <unk> ,

<unk> them on <unk> to strife .

for <unk> those so <unk> <unk> , my brain

parted , alas ! i carry from its source ,

that in this trunk <unk> . thus the law

of <unk> <unk> works in me . "

so were mine eyes <unk> with view

of the vast multitude , whom various wounds

<unk> , that they <unk> to stay and <unk> .

but virgil <unk> me : " what yet <unk> on ?

wherefore doth <unk> yet thy sight below

among the <unk> and miserable shades ?

thou hast not <unk> in any chasm beside

this <unk> . know , if thou wouldst number them

that two and <unk> <unk> the valley winds

its circuit , and already is the moon

beneath our feet : the time permitted now

is short , and more not seen remains to see . "

" if thou , " i straight replied , " <unk> <unk> the cause

for which i look'd , thou <unk> perchance <unk>

the <unk> still . " my leader part pursu'd

his way , the while i <unk> , answering him ,

and <unk> thus : " within that <unk> i deem ,

whereon so <unk> i held my ken ,

there is a spirit dwells , one of my blood ,

wailing the crime that <unk> him now so <unk> . "

then spake my master : " let thy soul no more

<unk> itself for him . direct elsewhere

its thought , and leave him . at the bridge's foot

i mark'd how he did point with <unk> look

at thee , and heard him by the others nam'd

<unk> of <unk> . thou so wholly then

<unk> <unk> with his spirit , who once <unk>

the towers of <unk> , that thou <unk> not

that way , ere he was gone . " -- " o guide belov'd !

his violent death yet <unk> , " said i ,

" by any , who are <unk> in his shame ,

made him <unk> : therefore , as i think ,

he pass'd me <unk> by ; and <unk> so

hath made me more <unk> his fate . "

so we <unk> to where the rock first show'd

the other valley , had more light been there ,

e'en to the lowest depth . soon as we came

o'er the last <unk> in the dismal <unk>

of malebolge , and the <unk>

were to our view expos'd , then many a <unk>

of sore lament assail'd me , <unk> all

with points of <unk> pity , that i clos'd

both ears against the <unk> with mine hands .

as were the torment , if each <unk> - <unk>

of <unk> , in the <unk> time

'twixt <unk> and <unk> , with the isle

<unk> and <unk> <unk> fen ,

had <unk> their <unk> all in one foss

together ; such was here the torment : dire

the <unk> , as issuing <unk> from <unk> limbs .

we on the utmost shore of the long rock

descended still to leftward . then my sight

was <unk> to explore the depth , wherein

the <unk> of the most mighty lord ,

all - <unk> justice , <unk> to punishment

the <unk> noted on her dread record .

more rueful was it not <unk> to see

the <unk> in <unk> <unk> , what time

each living thing , e'en to the little <unk> ,

all fell , so full of malice was the air

( and afterward , as <unk> of <unk> have told ,

the ancient people were restor'd <unk>

from seed of <unk> ) than was here to see

the spirits , that <unk> through the murky vale

up - <unk> on many a <unk> . <unk> they lay ,

one o'er the belly , o'er the shoulders one

roll'd of another ; <unk> <unk> a third

along the dismal <unk> . step by step

we journey'd on , in silence looking round

and <unk> those <unk> , who strove in vain

to <unk> their <unk> . then two i mark'd , that <unk>

<unk> 'gainst each other , as two <unk> <unk>

set to <unk> the heat . from head to foot ,

a <unk> <unk> them round . nor saw i e'er

<unk> <unk> so fast , for whom his lord

impatient waited , or himself perchance

<unk> with long <unk> , as of these each one

<unk> quickly his keen nails , through <unk>

of ne'er <unk> <unk> . the <unk>

came drawn from underneath in flakes , like <unk>

<unk> from the <unk> or <unk> of <unk> <unk> .

" o thou , who with thy <unk> <unk> off

thy <unk> of proof , " thus spake my guide to one ,

" and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of them ,

tell me if any born of latian land

be among these within : so may thy nails

serve thee for <unk> to this toil . "

" both are of <unk> , " weeping he replied ,

" whom tortur'd thus thou seest : but who art thou

that hast inquir'd of us ? " to whom my guide :

" one that descend with this man , who yet lives ,

from rock to rock , and <unk> him <unk> abyss . "

then <unk> they asunder , and each turn'd

trembling toward us , with the rest , whose ear

those words <unk> struck . to me my liege

address'd him : " speak to them whate'er thou <unk> . "

and i <unk> began : " so may no time

<unk> your remembrance from the thoughts of men

in th' upper world , but after many <unk>

<unk> it , as ye tell me , who ye are ,

and of what race ye come . your punishment ,

<unk> and disgustful in its kind ,

<unk> you not from opening thus much to me . "

" <unk> was my dwelling , " answer'd one ,

" and me <unk> of <unk> brought

to die by fire ; but that , for which i <unk> ,

leads me not here . true is in sport i told him ,

that i had learn'd to wing my flight in air .

and he <unk> much , as he was <unk>

of wisdom , will'd me to declare to him

the secret of mine art : and only hence ,

because i made him not a <unk> ,

<unk> on one <unk> his sire to <unk> me .

but minos to this chasm last of the ten ,

for that i practis'd <unk> on earth ,

has doom'd me . him no <unk> <unk> . "

then to the bard i spake : " was ever race

light as <unk> ? sure not <unk> herself

can <unk> a tribe so <unk> and vain . "

the other <unk> spirit heard my words ,

and thus return'd : " be <unk> from this charge

<unk> , he who knew so <unk>

to lay out <unk> <unk> ; and <unk>

who first the <unk> <unk> <unk>

discover'd in that <unk> , where such seed

<unk> <unk> in the soil : and be that troop

<unk> , with whom <unk> of <unk>

<unk> his <unk> and wide - <unk> <unk> ,

and his <unk> wisdom <unk> show'd

a <unk> for all . that thou mayst know

who <unk> thee against the <unk>

thus <unk> , bend this way thy sharpen'd sight ,

that well my face may answer to thy ken ;

so shalt thou see i am <unk> <unk> ,

who <unk> <unk> <unk> by the power

of <unk> ; and if i scan thee right ,

thus needs must well remember how i <unk>

<unk> nature by my <unk> art . "

what time <unk> burn'd in <unk> breast

for <unk> against the theban blood ,

as more than once in dire <unk> was rued ,

such fatal <unk> seiz'd on <unk> ,

that he his spouse <unk> with a <unk>

<unk> on either arm , " spread out , " he cried ,

" the <unk> , that i take the <unk>

and the young <unk> at the pass : " then forth

stretch'd he his <unk> talons , <unk> one ,

one helpless <unk> , <unk> nam'd ,

whom <unk> down he <unk> upon a rock ,

and with her other burden self - destroy'd

the <unk> mother <unk> : and when the pride

of all - <unk> troy fell from its height ,

by fortune <unk> , and the old king

with his realm <unk> , then did <unk> ,

a wretch <unk> and <unk> , when she saw

<unk> first <unk> , and her son ,

her <unk> , on the wild sea - <unk>

next met the <unk> view , then reft of sense

did she run <unk> even as a dog ;

such mighty power had grief to <unk> her soul .

<unk> ne'er the <unk> or of thebes or troy

with such fell cruelty were seen , their <unk>

<unk> in the limbs of man or beast ,

as now two pale and naked <unk> i saw

that <unk> <unk> <unk> , like the swine

<unk> from his <unk> . one reach'd <unk> ,

and in the neck - <unk> <unk> deep his fangs ,

dragg'd him , that o'er the solid <unk> <unk>

his belly stretch'd out prone . the other shape ,

he of <unk> , there left trembling , spake ;

" that <unk> of air is <unk> ; in like mood

of <unk> <unk> <unk> he still his <unk> . "

to whom i <unk> : " oh ! as thou dost hope ,

the other may not flesh its jaws on thee ,

be <unk> to inform us , who it is ,

ere it speed hence . " -- " that is the ancient soul

of wretched <unk> , " he replied , " who burn'd

with most <unk> flame for her own sire ,

" and a false shape <unk> , so <unk>

the deed of sin ; e'en as the other there ,

that onward passes , <unk> to <unk>

<unk> <unk> , to feign'd <unk>

the seal <unk> , that himself might <unk> ,

for his own <unk> , the lady of the herd . "

when vanish'd the two <unk> shades , on whom

mine eye was held , i turn'd it back to view

the other cursed spirits . one i saw

in fashion like a <unk> , had but the <unk>

been <unk> , where it <unk> the <unk> part .

<unk> <unk> , <unk> the limbs

with ill - <unk> <unk> , that the <unk>

suits not the visage , open'd wide his lips

<unk> as in the <unk> man for <unk> ,

one towards the <unk> , the other upward <unk> .

" o ye , who in this world of misery ,

wherefore i know not , are <unk> from pain , "

thus he began , " <unk> regard

<unk> woe . when living , full <unk>

ne'er <unk> me of what most i <unk> ;

one drop of water now , alas ! i <unk> .

the <unk> , that <unk> down the <unk> <unk>

of <unk> , <unk> fresh and <unk>

the banks whereby they <unk> to arno's stream ,

stand ever in my view ; and not in vain ;

for more the <unk> semblance <unk> me up ,

much more than the <unk> , which makes the flesh

desert these <unk> cheeks . so from the place ,

where i <unk> , stern justice <unk> me ,

takes means to <unk> more my <unk> sighs .

there is <unk> , where i <unk>

the <unk> with the <unk> form <unk> ,

for which on earth i left my body <unk> .

but if i here might see the <unk> soul

of guido , <unk> , or their <unk> ,

for <unk> <unk> spring i would not change

the <unk> sight . one is e'en now within ,

if <unk> the mad spirits tell , that round

are <unk> . but wherein <unk> me that ?

my limbs are <unk> . were i but so light ,

that i each hundred years might move one <unk> ,

i had set forth already on this path ,

<unk> him out amidst the <unk> crew ,

although <unk> <unk> it wind , not more

than <unk> of one across . they brought me down

among this tribe ; <unk> by them i <unk>

the <unk> with three <unk> of <unk> . "

" who are that <unk> <unk> , " i next inquir'd ,

" that <unk> <unk> thee upon thy right

lie <unk> , like a band in <unk> steep'd

in the <unk> stream ? " -- " when to this gulf i <unk> , "

he answer'd , " here i found them ; since that hour

they have not turn'd , nor ever shall , i <unk> ,

till time hath run his course . one is that dame

the false <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ;

<unk> the other , that false <unk> from troy .

sharp <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> out ,

in such a cloud <unk> . " when that he heard ,

one , <unk> perchance to be so <unk> nam'd ,

with <unk> hand smote him on the <unk> <unk> ,

that like a <unk> resounded : but forthwith

<unk> smote him on the face , the blow

returning with his arm , that seem'd as hard .

" though my <unk> limbs have <unk> from me

the power to move , " said he , " i have an arm

at <unk> for such <unk> . " to whom

was answer'd : " when thou <unk> to the fire ,

thou <unk> it not so ready at command ,

then <unk> when it <unk> th' <unk> gold . "

and thus the <unk> : " ay , now <unk> thou true .

but there thou <unk> not such true <unk> ,

when thou wast question'd of the truth , at troy . "

" if i spake false , thou <unk> <unk> the <unk> , "

said <unk> ; " i am here but for one fault ,

and thou for more than any <unk> beside . "

" remember , " he replied , " o <unk> one ,

the horse remember , that did <unk> with death ,

and all the world be witness to thy guilt . "

" to thine , " return'd the <unk> , " witness the <unk>

whence thy tongue <unk> , witness the <unk> mound ,

rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes ,

a mass <unk> . " to whom the <unk> thus :

" thy mouth <unk> wide as ever to let pass

its evil <unk> . me if <unk> <unk> ,

yet i am <unk> with <unk> . thou art <unk> ,

pains <unk> thy head , no <unk> <unk> thou need

to make thee <unk> <unk> <unk> up . "

i was all fix'd to listen , when my guide

<unk> : " now <unk> : a little more .

and i do <unk> with thee . " i perceiv'd

how <unk> he spake , and towards him turn'd

with shame so <unk> , as remember'd yet

<unk> me . as a man that <unk> of harm

<unk> him , dreaming wishes it a <unk> ,

and that which is , <unk> as if it were not ,

such then was i , who <unk> power to speak

wish'd to <unk> myself , and all the while

<unk> me , though <unk> that i did .

" more <unk> fault than thine has been , less shame , "

my master cried , " might <unk> . therefore cast

all sorrow from thy soul ; and if again

chance bring thee , where like <unk> is held ,

think i am ever at thy side . to hear

such <unk> is a joy for <unk> minds . "

the <unk> tongue , whose keen <unk> before

had <unk> me , that either cheek was stain'd ,

now <unk> my cure . so have i heard ,

achilles and his <unk> <unk> <unk>

pain first , and then the <unk> of <unk> restor'd .

turning our back upon the vale of woe ,

<unk> <unk> th' <unk> mound in silence . there

was <unk> dim , that far long the gloom

mine eye advanc'd not : but i heard a horn

<unk> aloud . the <unk> it <unk> had made

the thunder <unk> . following its course

the adverse way , my <unk> eyes were bent

on that one spot . so terrible a blast

<unk> <unk> not , when that dismal <unk>

<unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and quench'd

his <unk> warfare . <unk> not long

my head was rais'd , when many lofty towers

methought i spied . " master , " said i , " what land

is this ? " he answer'd straight : " too long a space

of <unk> darkness has thine eye

to <unk> : thou hast therefore <unk> <unk>

in thy <unk> . thither arriv'd

thou well shalt see , how <unk> can <unk>

the sense . a little therefore urge thee on . "

then <unk> he caught me by the hand ;

" yet know , " said he , " ere farther we advance ,

that it less strange may seem , these are not towers ,

but <unk> . in the <unk> they stand immers'd ,

each from his <unk> downward , round the bank . "

as when a <unk> <unk> <unk> ,

our <unk> <unk> what the mist <unk>

<unk> in air ; so piercing through the gross

and gloomy <unk> , as more and more

we <unk> toward the brink , mine error fled ,

and fear came o'er me . as with circling round

of <unk> , <unk> <unk> his walls ,

e'en thus the shore , <unk> th' abyss ,

was <unk> with <unk> , <unk> their length

<unk> , horrible , whom <unk> from heav'n

yet <unk> , when his <unk> thunder <unk> .

of one already i descried the face ,

shoulders , and breast , and of the belly huge

great part , and both arms down along his <unk> .

all - <unk> nature , when her <unk> hand

left <unk> of these <unk> , did <unk>

past doubt her wisdom , <unk> from mad war

such <unk> to do his <unk> ; and if she

<unk> her not of th' <unk> and <unk> ,

who <unk> well <unk> her <unk>

<unk> and more <unk> ; for when brute force

and evil will are <unk> with <unk> ,

<unk> none avails . his visage seem'd

in length and <unk> , as doth the <unk> , that <unk>

saint peter's <unk> <unk> ; and th' other bones

of like <unk> , so that from above

the bank , which <unk> him below , such height

<unk> his <unk> , that three <unk>

had <unk> in vain to <unk> but to his hair .

full <unk> ample palms was he expos'd

downward from whence a man his <unk> <unk> .
