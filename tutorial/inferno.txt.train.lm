in the midway of this our <unk> life ,

i found me in a gloomy wood , <unk>

gone from the path direct : and e'en to tell

it were no easy task , how savage wild

that forest , how <unk> and rough its <unk> ,

which to remember only , my <unk>

<unk> , in <unk> not far from death .

yet to discourse of what there good befell ,

all else will i relate discover'd there .

how first i enter'd it i scarce can say ,

such <unk> <unk> in that instant <unk>

my senses down , when the true path i left ,

but when a mountain's foot i reach'd , where clos'd

the valley , that had pierc'd my heart with dread ,

i look'd aloft , and saw his shoulders broad

already <unk> with that <unk> beam ,

who leads all <unk> safe through every way .

then was a little <unk> to the fear ,

that in my <unk> <unk> deep had <unk> ,

all of that night , so <unk> pass'd :

and as a man , with <unk> short breath ,

<unk> with <unk> , 'scap'd from sea to shore ,

turns to the perilous wide waste , and stands

at gaze ; e'en so my spirit , that yet fail'd

struggling with terror , turn'd to view the straits ,

that none hath pass'd and liv'd . my weary frame

after short pause <unk> , again

i journey'd on over that <unk> steep ,

the hinder foot still <unk> . scarce the <unk>

began , when , lo ! a <unk> , nimble , light ,

and cover'd with a <unk> skin , appear'd ,

nor , when it saw me , vanish'd , rather strove

to <unk> my onward going ; that ofttimes

with purpose to retrace my steps i turn'd .

the hour was <unk> <unk> , and on his way

aloft the sun ascended with those stars ,

that with him rose , when love divine first mov'd

those its fair works : so that with joyous hope

all things <unk> to fill me , the <unk> skin

of that swift animal , the <unk> dawn

and the sweet season . soon that joy was chas'd ,

and by new dread succeeded , when in view

a lion came , 'gainst me , as it appear'd ,

with his head held aloft and hunger - mad ,

that e'en the air was fear - struck . a she - wolf

was at his <unk> , who in her leanness seem'd

full of all <unk> , and many a land hath made

<unk> ere now . she with such fear

<unk> me , at the sight of her <unk> ,

that of the height all hope i lost . as one ,

who with his <unk> <unk> , sees the time

when all <unk> is gone , he inwardly

mourns with heart - griping anguish ; such was i ,

<unk> by that fell beast , never at peace ,

who coming o'er against me , by degrees

impell'd me where the sun in silence rests .

while to the lower space with backward step

i fell , my ken discern'd the form one of one ,

whose voice seem'd faint through long <unk> of speech .

when him in that great desert i espied ,

" have mercy on me ! " cried i out aloud ,

" spirit ! or living man ! what e'er thou be ! "

he answer'd : " now not man , man once i was ,

and born of lombard parents , <unk> both

by country , when the power of <unk> yet

was scarcely firm . at rome my life was past

beneath the mild augustus , in the time

of <unk> <unk> and false . a bard

was i , and made anchises' upright son

the subject of my song , who came from troy ,

when the flames <unk> on <unk> <unk> towers .

but thou , say wherefore to such perils past

return'st thou ? wherefore not this pleasant mount

<unk> , cause and source of all delight ? "

" and art thou then that virgil , that well - spring ,

from which such <unk> <unk> of eloquence

have issued ? " i with front <unk> replied .

" glory and light of all the tuneful train !

may it avail me that i long with zeal

have sought thy <unk> , and with love <unk>

have <unk> it o'er . my master thou and guide !

thou he from whom alone i have deriv'd

that <unk> , which for its <unk> into fame

<unk> me . see the beast , from whom i fled .

o save me from her , thou <unk> sage ! "

" for every vein and <unk> throughout my frame

she hath made tremble . " he , soon as he saw

that i was weeping , answer'd , " thou must needs

another way pursue , if thou wouldst 'scape

from out that savage wilderness . this beast ,

at whom thou criest , her way will suffer none

to pass , and no less hindrance makes than death :

so bad and so accursed in her kind ,

that never <unk> is her ravenous will ,

still after food more craving than before .

to many an animal in <unk> vile

she fastens , and shall yet to many more ,

until that <unk> come , who shall <unk>

her with sharp pain . he will not life <unk>

by earth nor its base <unk> , but by love ,

wisdom , and virtue , and his land shall be

the land 'twixt either <unk> . in his might

shall safety to <unk> plains arise ,

for whose fair realm , camilla , virgin pure ,

<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> fell .

he with <unk> chase through every <unk>

shall <unk> , until he to hell at length

<unk> her , thence by envy first let loose .

i for thy profit pond'ring now devise ,

that thou mayst follow me , and i thy guide

will lead thee hence through an eternal space ,

where thou shalt hear <unk> shrieks , and see

spirits of old tormented , who <unk>

a second death ; and those next view , who dwell

content in fire , for that they hope to come ,

<unk> the time may be , among the blest ,

into whose regions if thou then desire

t' ascend , a spirit <unk> then i

must lead thee , in whose charge , when i depart ,

thou shalt be left : for that almighty king ,

who reigns above , a <unk> to his law ,

<unk> me , and therefore hath decreed ,

that to his city none through me should come .

he in all parts hath sway ; there rules , there holds

his <unk> and <unk> . o happy those ,

whom there he <unk> ! " i to him in few :

" bard ! by that god , whom thou didst not <unk> ,

i do <unk> thee ( that this ill and worse

i may escape ) to lead me , where thou saidst ,

that i saint peter's gate may view , and those

who as thou tell'st , are in such dismal plight . "

onward he mov'd , i close his steps pursu'd .

now was the day departing , and the air ,

<unk> with <unk> , from their toils <unk>

all animals on earth ; and i alone

prepar'd myself the <unk> to sustain ,

both of sad pity , and that perilous road ,

which my <unk> memory shall retrace .

o <unk> ! o high genius ! now vouchsafe

your aid ! o mind ! that all i saw hast kept

safe in a <unk> record , here thy worth

and eminent <unk> come to proof .

i thus began : " bard ! thou who art my guide ,

<unk> well , if virtue be in me

<unk> , ere to this high enterprise

thou trust me . thou hast told that <unk> sire ,

yet cloth'd in <unk> flesh , among

th' <unk> tribes had entrance , and was there

<unk> present . yet if heaven's great lord ,

almighty foe to ill , such favour shew'd ,

in <unk> of the high effect ,

both what and who from him should issue forth ,

it seems in <unk> judgment well deserv'd :

sith he of rome , and of <unk> <unk> wide ,

in heaven's <unk> height was chosen sire :

both which , if truth be spoken , were ordain'd

and <unk> for the holy place , where sits

who to great peter's sacred <unk> <unk> .

he from this journey , in thy song renown'd ,

learn'd things , that to his <unk> gave rise

and to the <unk> <unk> . in after - times

the chosen vessel also <unk> there ,

to bring us back assurance in that faith ,

which is the entrance to <unk> way .

but i , why should i there <unk> ? or who

<unk> it ? not , aeneas i nor <unk> .

myself i deem not worthy , and none else

will deem me . i , if on this voyage then

i <unk> , fear it will in <unk> end .

thou , who art <unk> , better my meaning know'st ,

than i can speak . " as one , who <unk>

what he hath late resolv'd , and with new thoughts

changes his purpose , from his first intent

remov'd ; e'en such was i on that dun coast ,

<unk> in thought my enterprise , at first

so eagerly <unk> . " if right thy words

i scan , " replied that shade <unk> ,

" thy soul is by vile fear assail'd , which oft

so <unk> a man , that he recoils

from <unk> <unk> , like a beast

at some false semblance in the <unk> gloom .

that from this terror thou mayst <unk> thyself ,

i will instruct thee why i came , and what

i heard in that same instant , when for thee

grief touch'd me first . i was among the tribe ,

who rest suspended , when a dame , so blest

and lovely , i besought her to command ,

call'd me ; her eyes were brighter than the star

of day ; and she with gentle voice and <unk>

<unk> <unk> her speech address'd :

" o courteous shade of mantua ! thou whose fame

yet lives , and shall live long as nature <unk> !

a friend , not of my fortune but myself ,

on the wide desert in his road has met

hindrance so great , that he through fear has turn'd .

now much i dread lest he past help have <unk> ,

and i be <unk> too late for his <unk> ,

from what in heaven of him i heard . speed now ,

and by thy <unk> <unk> tongue ,

and by all means for his <unk> meet ,

<unk> him . so to me will comfort spring .

i who now bid thee on this <unk> forth

am beatrice ; from a place i come

( note : beatrice . i use this word , as it is

<unk> in the <unk> , as <unk> of four

<unk> , of which the third is a long one . )

<unk> with joy . love brought me thence ,

who <unk> my speech . when in my master's sight

i stand , thy praise to him i oft will tell . "

she then was silent , and i thus began :

" o lady ! by whose <unk> alone ,

mankind <unk> <unk> is contain'd

within that heaven which hath the <unk> orb ,

so thy command <unk> me , that to obey ,

if it were done already , would seem late .

no need hast thou farther to speak thy will ;

yet tell the reason , why thou art not loth

to leave that ample space , where to return

thou <unk> , for this centre here beneath . "

she then : " since thou so deeply wouldst inquire ,

i will instruct thee briefly , why no dread

<unk> my entrance here . those things alone

are to be fear'd , whence evil may proceed ,

none else , for none are terrible beside .

i am so fram'd by god , thanks to his <unk> !

that any <unk> of your misery

touches me not , nor flame of that fierce fire

<unk> me . in high heaven a blessed dame

besides , who mourns with such <unk> grief

that hindrance , which i <unk> thee to <unk> ,

that god's stern judgment to her will <unk> . "

to lucia calling , her she thus bespake :

" now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid

and i commend him to thee . " at her word

sped lucia , of all cruelty the foe ,

and coming to the place , where i <unk>

seated with rachel , her of ancient days ,

she thus address'd me : " thou true praise of god !

beatrice ! why is not thy succour <unk>

to him , who so much lov'd thee , as to leave

for thy sake all the multitude <unk> ?

dost thou not hear how <unk> his wail ,

nor mark the death , which in the torrent flood ,

<unk> <unk> than a sea , him struggling holds ? "

" ne'er among men did any with such speed

haste to their profit , <unk> from their annoy ,

as when these words were spoken , i came here ,

down from my blessed seat , <unk> the force

of thy pure eloquence , which thee , and all

who well have mark'd it , into honour brings . "

" when she had ended , her bright <unk> eyes

<unk> she turn'd <unk> ; whereat i felt

<unk> zeal to serve thee . as she will'd ,

thus am i come : i sav'd thee from the beast ,

who thy near way across the goodly mount

<unk> . what is this comes o'er thee then ?

why , why dost thou <unk> back ? why in thy breast

<unk> vile fear ? why hast not courage there

and noble <unk> ? since three <unk> so blest

thy safety <unk> , e'en in the <unk> of heaven ;

and so much certain good my words forebode . "

as <unk> , by the <unk> air of night

bent down and clos'd , when day has <unk> their leaves ,

rise all <unk> on their <unk> <unk> ;

so was my fainting <unk> new restor'd ,

and to my heart such kindly courage ran ,

that i as one <unk> soon replied :

" o full of pity she , who <unk>

my succour ! and thou kind who didst <unk>

so soon her true <unk> ! with such desire

thou hast <unk> me to <unk> my voyage ,

that my first purpose fully is resum'd .

lead on : one only will is in us both .

thou art my guide , my master thou , and lord . "

so spake i ; and when he had onward mov'd ,

i enter'd on the deep and <unk> way .

" through me you pass into the city of woe :

through me you pass into eternal pain :

through me among the people lost for aye .

justice the <unk> of my <unk> mov'd :

to rear me was the task of power divine ,

<unk> wisdom , and <unk> love .

before me things <unk> were none , save things

eternal , and eternal i endure .

" all hope <unk> ye who enter here . "

such <unk> in colour dim i mark'd

over a <unk> lofty arch <unk> :

whereat i thus : " master , these words import

hard meaning . " he as one prepar'd replied :

" here thou must all <unk> behind thee leave ;

here be vile fear extinguish'd . we are come

where i have told thee we shall see the souls

to misery doom'd , who <unk> good

have lost . " and when his hand he had stretch'd forth

to mine , with pleasant looks , whence i was <unk> ,

into that secret place he led me on .

here sighs with lamentations and loud moans

resounded through the air pierc'd by no star ,

that e'en i wept at <unk> . various tongues ,

horrible <unk> , <unk> of woe ,

<unk> of anger , voices deep and hoarse ,

with hands together smote that swell'd the sounds ,

made up a <unk> , that for ever <unk>

round through that air with solid darkness stain'd ,

like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies .

i then , with error yet <unk> , cried :

" o master ! what is this i hear ? what race

are these , who seem so overcome with woe ? "

he thus to me : " this miserable fate

suffer the wretched souls of those , who liv'd

without or praise or blame , with that ill band

of angels mix'd , who nor <unk> prov'd

nor yet were true to god , but for themselves

were only . from his bounds heaven drove them forth ,

not to <unk> his lustre , nor the depth

of hell <unk> them , lest th' accursed tribe

should glory thence with <unk> vain . "

i then : " master ! what doth <unk> them thus ,

that they lament so loud ? " he straight replied :

" that will i tell thee briefly . these of death

no hope may <unk> : and their blind life

so meanly passes , that all other lots

they envy . fame of them the world hath none ,

nor <unk> ; mercy and justice scorn them both .

speak not of them , but look , and pass them by . "

and i , who straightway look'd , beheld a flag ,

which <unk> ran around so <unk> ,

that it no pause obtain'd : and following came

such a long train of spirits , i should ne'er

have thought , that death so many had <unk> .

when some of these i <unk> , i saw

and knew the shade of him , who to base fear

yielding , <unk> his high estate . forthwith

i understood for certain this the tribe

of those ill spirits both to god displeasing

and to his foes . these wretches , who ne'er <unk> ,

went on in <unk> , and sorely stung

by <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> their cheeks

with blood , that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet ,

and by disgustful <unk> was gather'd there .

then looking farther <unk> i beheld

a throng upon the shore of a great stream :

whereat i thus : " sir ! grant me now to know

whom here we view , and whence impell'd they seem

so eager to pass o'er , as i discern

through the <unk> light ? " he thus to me in few :

" this shalt thou know , soon as our steps arrive

beside the woeful tide of acheron . "

then with eyes downward cast and fill'd with shame ,

fearing my words <unk> to his ear ,

till we had reach'd the river , i from speech

abstain'd . and lo ! toward us in a bark

comes on an old man <unk> white with <unk> ,

<unk> , " woe to you <unk> spirits ! hope not

ever to see the sky again . i come

to take you to the other shore across ,

into eternal darkness , there to dwell

in fierce heat and in <unk> . and thou , who there

standest , live spirit ! <unk> thee hence , and leave

these who are dead . " but soon as he beheld

i left them not , " by other way , " said he ,

" by other haven shalt thou come to shore ,

not by this passage ; thee a <unk> <unk>

must carry . " then to him thus spake my guide :

" charon ! thyself torment not : so 't is will'd ,

where will and power are one : ask thou no more . "

straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks

of him the <unk> o'er the livid lake ,

around whose eyes <unk> wheeling flames . meanwhile

those spirits , faint and naked , <unk> chang'd ,

and <unk> their teeth , soon as the cruel words

they heard . god and their parents they <unk> ,

the human kind , the place , the time , and seed

that did <unk> them and give them birth .

then all together sorely wailing drew

to the curs'd <unk> , that every man must pass

who <unk> not god . charon , demoniac form ,

with eyes of burning <unk> , <unk> them all ,

beck'ning , and each , that <unk> , with his <unk>

strikes . as fall off the light <unk> leaves ,

one still another following , till the bough

<unk> all its honours on the earth beneath ;

e'en in like <unk> <unk> evil brood

cast themselves one by one down from the shore ,

each at a <unk> , as falcon at his call .

thus go they over through the <unk> wave ,

and ever they on the <unk> bank

be <unk> , on this side another throng

still <unk> . " son , " thus spake the courteous guide ,

" those , who die subject to the wrath of god ,

all here together come from every clime ,

and to <unk> the river are not loth :

for so heaven's justice <unk> them on , that fear

is turn'd into desire . hence ne'er hath past

good spirit . if of thee charon <unk> ,

now mayst thou know the import of his words . "

this said , the gloomy region trembling shook

so <unk> , that yet with <unk> <unk>

fear <unk> my brow . the sad earth gave a blast ,

that , <unk> , shot forth a vermilion flame ,

which all my senses <unk> quite , and i

down dropp'd , as one with sudden slumber seiz'd .

broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash

of heavy thunder , that i shook myself ,

as one by main force <unk> . risen upright ,

my <unk> eyes i mov'd around , and search'd

with fixed ken to know what place it was ,

wherein i stood . for certain on the brink

i found me of the lamentable vale ,

the dread abyss , that joins a <unk> sound

of <unk> <unk> . dark and deep ,

and thick with <unk> <unk> , mine eye in vain

explor'd its bottom , nor could aught discern .

" now let us to the blind world there beneath

descend ; " the bard began all pale of look :

" i go the first , and thou shalt follow next . "

then i his alter'd hue perceiving , thus :

" how may i speed , if thou <unk> to dread ,

who still art wont to comfort me in doubt ? "

he then : " the anguish of that race below

with pity <unk> my cheek , which thou for fear

<unk> . let us on . our length of way

urges to haste . " onward , this said , he mov'd ;

and ent'ring led me with him on the bounds

of the first circle , that <unk> th' abyss .

here , as mine ear could note , no <unk> was heard

except of sighs , that made th' eternal air

tremble , not <unk> by tortures , but from grief

felt by those multitudes , many and vast ,

of men , women , and <unk> . then to me

the gentle guide : " <unk> thou not what spirits

are these , which thou beholdest ? ere thou pass

farther , i would thou know , that these of sin

were blameless ; and if aught they merited ,

it profits not , since <unk> was not theirs ,

the portal to thy faith . if they before

the <unk> liv'd , they serv'd not god <unk> ;

and among such am i . for these <unk> ,

and for no other evil , we are lost ; "

" only so far afflicted , that we live

<unk> without hope . " so grief assail'd

my heart at hearing this , for well i knew

suspended in that <unk> many a soul

of mighty worth . " o tell me , sire rever'd !

tell me , my master ! " i began through wish

of full assurance in that holy faith ,

which <unk> all error ; " say , did e'er

any , or through his own or other's merit ,

come forth from thence , whom afterward was blest ? "

piercing the secret <unk> of my speech ,

he answer'd : " i was new to that estate ,

when i beheld a <unk> one arrive

amongst us , with <unk> <unk> crown'd .

he forth the shade of our first parent drew ,

<unk> his child , and <unk> <unk> man ,

of <unk> <unk> for faith <unk> ,

of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> king ,

<unk> with his sire and with his <unk> ,

nor without rachel whom so hard he won ,

and others many more , whom he to bliss

exalted . before these , be thou assur'd ,

no spirit of human kind was ever sav'd . "

we , while he spake , ceas'd not our onward road ,

still passing through the wood ; for so i name

those spirits thick beset . we were not far

on this side from the summit , when i kenn'd

a flame , that o'er the <unk> hemisphere

<unk> <unk> . yet we a little space

were distant , not so far but i in part

discover'd , that a tribe in honour high

that place possess'd . " o thou , who every art

and <unk> <unk> ! who are these , that <unk>

such honour , separate from all the rest ? "

he answer'd : " the renown of their great names

that <unk> through your world above , <unk>

favour in heaven , which holds them thus advanc'd . "

meantime a voice i heard : " honour the bard

<unk> ! his shade returns that left us late ! "

no sooner ceas'd the sound , than i beheld

four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps ,

of semblance neither <unk> nor glad .

when thus my master kind began : " mark him ,

who in his right hand bears that <unk> keen ,

the other three <unk> , as their lord .

this is that <unk> , of all <unk> supreme :

<unk> the next in <unk> vein <unk> ;

the third is <unk> ; lucan is the last .

because they all that <unk> own ,

with which the voice singly <unk> me ,

<unk> they <unk> me thus , and well they judge . "

so i beheld <unk> the bright <unk>

of him the monarch of <unk> song ,

that o'er the others like an eagle <unk> .

when they together short discourse had held ,

they turn'd to me , with <unk> kind

beck'ning me ; at the which my master <unk> :

nor was this all ; but greater honour still

they gave me , for they made me of their tribe ;

and i was sixth amid so learn'd a band .

far as the <unk> <unk> on we pass'd

speaking of <unk> , then <unk> well

to speak , now <unk> left <unk> . at foot

of a <unk> castle we arriv'd ,

seven times with lofty walls <unk> , and round

<unk> by a pleasant stream . o'er this

as o'er dry land we pass'd . next through seven gates

i with those sages enter'd , and we came

into a <unk> with <unk> <unk> fresh .

there dwelt a race , who <unk> their eyes around

<unk> mov'd , and in their port

bore eminent authority ; they spake

<unk> , but all their words were tuneful sweet .

we to one side retir'd , into a place

open and bright and lofty , whence each one

stood manifest to view . <unk>

there on the green <unk> of the plain

were shown me the great spirits , by whose sight

i am exalted in my own <unk> .

<unk> there i saw accompanied

by many , among whom <unk> i knew ,

anchises' <unk> son , and with <unk> eye

<unk> all arm'd , and by camilla there

<unk> . on the other side

old king <unk> , seated by his child

<unk> , and that <unk> i beheld ,

who <unk> chas'd , <unk> , cato's wife

<unk> , with <unk> and <unk> there ;

and sole apart retir'd , the soldan fierce .

then when a little more i rais'd my brow ,

i spied the master of the sapient throng ,

seated amid the <unk> train .

him all <unk> , all <unk> him <unk> due .

there <unk> and <unk> both i mark'd ,

nearest to him in rank ; <unk> ,

who sets the world at chance , <unk> ,

with <unk> , and <unk> ,

and <unk> , and <unk> sage ,

<unk> , and <unk> well read

in nature's secret lore . <unk> i mark'd

and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> ,

<unk> and <unk> , <unk> ,

<unk> , <unk> , and him who made

that <unk> vast , <unk> .

of all to speak at full were vain <unk> ;

for my wide theme so urges , that ofttimes

my words fall short of what <unk> . in two

the six associates part . another way

my sage guide leads me , from that air serene ,

into a <unk> ever <unk> with storms :

and to a part i come where no light shines .

from the first circle i descended thus

down to the second , which , a lesser space

embracing , so much more of grief contains

<unk> bitter moans . there , minos stands

<unk> with <unk> feature : he , of all

who enter , strict <unk> the crimes ,

gives sentence , and <unk> them beneath ,

according as he <unk> him around :

for when before him comes th' ill fated soul ,

it all <unk> ; and that judge severe

of sins , <unk> what place in hell

suits the <unk> , with his tail so oft

himself <unk> , as degrees beneath

he <unk> it to descend . before him stand

<unk> a <unk> throng ; and in his turn

each one to judgment passing , <unk> , and hears

his fate , thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd .

" o thou ! who to this <unk> of woe

<unk> ? " when he saw me coming , cried

minos , <unk> his dread <unk> ,

" look how thou enter here ; <unk> in whom

thou place thy trust ; let not the entrance broad

<unk> thee to thy harm . " to him my guide :

" wherefore <unk> ? hinder not his way

by destiny <unk> ; so 'tis will'd

where will and power are one . ask thou no more . "

now <unk> the rueful wailings to be heard .

now am i come where many a <unk> voice

smites on mine ear . into a place i came

where light was silent all . <unk> there <unk>

a noise as of a sea in tempest torn

by <unk> winds . the stormy blast of hell

with restless fury drives the spirits on

whirl'd round and <unk> amain with sore annoy .

when they arrive before the <unk> <unk> ,

there shrieks are heard , there lamentations , moans ,

and <unk> 'gainst the good power in heaven .

i understood that to this torment sad

the <unk> sinners are condemn'd , in whom

reason by lust is sway'd . as in large <unk>

and <unk> , when <unk> reigns ,

the <unk> on their wings are borne abroad ;

so bears the <unk> <unk> those evil souls .

on this side and on that , above , below ,

it drives them : hope of rest to <unk> them

is none , nor e'en of milder pang . as <unk> ,

chanting their <unk> notes , <unk> the sky ,

stretch'd out in long <unk> : so i beheld

spirits , who came loud wailing , <unk> on

by their dire doom . then i : " instructor ! who

are these , by the black air so <unk> ? " -- " the first

<unk> those , of whom thou <unk> , " he replied ,

" o'er many tongues was <unk> . she in vice

of <unk> was so <unk> , that she made

<unk> be lawful by <unk> <unk> ,

to clear the blame she had herself incurr'd .

this is <unk> , of whom 'tis <unk> ,

that she succeeded <unk> her <unk> ;

and held the land , which now the soldan rules .

the next in <unk> fury <unk> herself ,

and to <unk> ashes broke her faith :

then follows <unk> , <unk> queen . "

there mark'd i <unk> , for whose sake so long

the time was <unk> with evil ; there the great

achilles , who with love fought to the end .

<unk> i saw , and <unk> ; and beside

a thousand more he show'd me , and by name

pointed them out , whom love <unk> of life .

when i had heard my sage instructor name

those <unk> and <unk> of <unk> days , <unk>

by pity , well - nigh in amaze my mind

was lost ; and i began : " bard ! <unk>

i would <unk> those two together coming ,

which seem so light before the wind . " he thus :

" note thou , when nearer they to us approach . "

" then by that love which carries them along ,

entreat ; and they will come . " soon as the wind

sway'd them toward us , i thus fram'd my speech :

" o wearied spirits ! come , and hold discourse

with us , if by none else restrain'd . " as <unk>

by fond desire <unk> , on wide wings

and firm , to their sweet nest returning <unk> ,

<unk> the air , <unk> by their will along ;

thus issu'd from that troop , where <unk> <unk> ,

they through the ill air <unk> ; with such force

my cry <unk> by strong <unk> urg'd .

" o gracious <unk> and benign ! who go'st

<unk> , through this <unk> <unk> ,

us , who the world with bloody stain imbru'd ;

if for a friend the king of all we <unk> ,

our <unk> to him should for thy peace arise ,

since thou hast pity on our evil plight .

( ) <unk> whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse

it pleases thee , that will we hear , of that

freely with thee discourse , while e'er the wind ,

as now , is mute . the land , that gave me birth ,

is <unk> on the coast , where po descends

to rest in ocean with his <unk> streams .

" love , that in gentle heart is quickly <unk> ,

<unk> him by that fair form , from me

<unk> in such cruel sort , as grieves me still :

love , that <unk> takes from none belov'd ,

caught me with <unk> him so passing well ,

that , as thou see'st , he yet <unk> me not .

" love brought us to one death : <unk> <unk>

the soul , who <unk> our life . " such were their words ;

at hearing which downward i bent my looks ,

and held them there so long , that the bard cried :

" what art thou pond'ring ? " i in answer thus :

" alas ! by what sweet thoughts , what fond desire

must they at length to that ill pass have reach'd ! "

then turning , i to them my speech address'd .

and thus began : " <unk> ! your sad fate

even to tears my grief and pity moves .

but tell me ; in the time of your sweet sighs ,

by what , and how love granted , that ye knew

your yet <unk> wishes ? " she replied :

" no greater grief than to remember days

of joy , when <unk> is at hand ! that <unk>

thy learn'd instructor . yet so eagerly

if thou art bent to know the primal <unk> ,

from whence our love <unk> <unk> , i will do ,

as one , who <unk> and tells his tale . one day

for our delight we read of <unk> ,

how him love <unk> . alone we were , and no

suspicion near us . ofttimes by that reading

our eyes were drawn together , and the hue

fled from our alter'd cheek . but at one point

alone we fell . when of that smile we read ,

the <unk> smile , <unk> kiss'd

by one so deep in love , then he , who ne'er

from me shall separate , at once my lips

all trembling kiss'd . the book and <unk> both

were <unk> <unk> . in its leaves that day

we read no more . " while thus one spirit spake ,

the other <unk> so sorely , that <unk>

i through <unk> fainting , seem'd not far

from death , and like a <unk> fell to the ground .

my sense <unk> , that erewhile had <unk>

with pity for the <unk> shades , whence grief

<unk> me wholly , straight around i see

new torments , new tormented souls , which way

<unk> i move , or turn , or bend my sight .

in the third circle i arrive , of <unk>

ceaseless , accursed , heavy , and <unk> , <unk>

for ever , both in kind and in degree .

large <unk> , <unk> water , <unk> <unk>

through the dun <unk> air <unk> down amain :

<unk> all the land whereon that tempest fell .

cerberus , cruel monster , fierce and strange ,

through his wide <unk> throat <unk> as a dog

over the multitude immers'd beneath .

his eyes <unk> crimson , black his unctuous beard ,

his belly large , and <unk> the hands , with which

he tears the spirits , <unk> them , and their limbs

piecemeal disparts . <unk> there spread , as <unk> ,

under the <unk> <unk> , with one side

the other <unk> , oft they roll them round ,

a wretched , <unk> crew . when that great <unk>

descried us , savage cerberus , he <unk>

his jaws , and the fangs show'd us ; not a limb

of him but <unk> . then my guide , his palms

<unk> on the ground , thence <unk> with earth

rais'd them , and cast it in his ravenous maw .

e'en as a dog , that <unk> <unk> for food

his <unk> , when the <unk> comes , lets fall

his fury , bent alone with eager haste

to <unk> it ; so dropp'd the <unk> cheeks

of demon cerberus , who <unk> <unk>

the spirits , that they for <unk> wish in vain .

we , o'er the shades <unk> prostrate by the <unk>

of the heavy tempest passing , set our feet

upon their <unk> , that substance seem'd .

they all along the earth extended lay

save one , that sudden rais'd himself to sit ,

soon as that way he saw us pass . " o thou ! "

he cried , " who through the <unk> shades art led ,

own , if again thou know'st me . thou wast fram'd

or ere my frame was broken . " i replied :

" the anguish thou <unk> perchance so takes

thy form from my remembrance , that it seems

as if i saw thee never . but inform

me who thou art , that in a place so sad

art set , and in such torment , that although

other be greater , more disgustful none

can be <unk> . " he in answer thus :

" thy city <unk> with envy to the <unk> ,

ay that the measure <unk> its bounds ,

held me in brighter days . ye citizens

were wont to name me ciacco . for the sin

of <unk> , <unk> vice , beneath this rain ,

e'en as thou see'st , i with <unk> am worn ;

nor i sole spirit in this woe : all these

have by like crime incurr'd like punishment . "

no more he said , and i my speech resum'd :

" ciacco ! thy dire <unk> grieves me much ,

even to tears . but tell me , if thou know'st ,

what shall at length befall the citizens

of the divided city ; whether any just one

<unk> there : and tell me of the cause ,

whence <unk> <unk> hath assail'd it thus ? "

he then : " after long <unk> they will come

to blood ; and the wild party from the <unk>

will chase the other with much injury forth .

then it behoves , that this must fall , within

three <unk> circles ; and the other rise

by <unk> force of one , who under shore

now rests . it shall a long space hold aloof

its forehead , keeping under heavy weight

the other oppress'd , <unk> at the load ,

and <unk> sore . the just are two in number ,

but they <unk> . av'rice , envy , pride ,

three fatal sparks , have set the hearts of all

on fire . " here ceas'd the lamentable sound ;

and i continu'd thus : " still would i learn

more from thee , farther parley still entreat .

of farinata and <unk> say ,

they who so well deserv'd , of <unk> ,

<unk> , <unk> , and the rest , who bent

their minds on <unk> good . oh ! tell me where

they <unk> , and to their knowledge let me come .

for i am press'd with keen desire to hear ,

if heaven's sweet <unk> or <unk> <unk> of hell

be to their lip assign'd . " he answer'd straight :

" these are yet <unk> spirits . various crimes

have sunk them <unk> in the dark abyss .

if thou so far <unk> , thou mayst see them .

but to the pleasant world when thou return'st ,

of me make <unk> , i entreat thee , there .

no more i tell thee , answer thee no more . "

this said , his fixed eyes he turn'd askance ,

a little ey'd me , then bent down his head ,

and 'midst his blind companions with it fell .

when thus my guide : " no more his bed he leaves ,

ere the last <unk> - trumpet blow . the power

adverse to these shall then in glory come ,

each one forthwith to his sad tomb <unk> ,

<unk> his <unk> <unk> and his form ,

and hear the eternal doom re - <unk> rend

the vault . " so pass'd we through that <unk> foul

of spirits and rain , with tardy steps ; meanwhile

touching , though <unk> , on the life to come .

for thus i question'd : " shall these tortures , sir !

when the great sentence passes , be <unk> ,

or <unk> , or as now severe ? "

he then : " <unk> thy knowledge ; that <unk>

that as each thing to more perfection grows ,

it feels more <unk> both good and pain .

though ne'er to true perfection may arrive

this race accurs'd , yet nearer then than now

they shall approach it . " <unk> that path

<unk> we <unk> , and discourse

much more than i relate between us pass'd :

till at the point , where the steps led below ,

arriv'd , there plutus , the great foe , we found .

" ah me ! o satan ! satan ! " loud exclaim'd

plutus , in accent hoarse of wild <unk> :

and the kind sage , whom no <unk> surpris'd ,

to comfort me thus spake : " let not thy fear

harm thee , for power in him , be sure , is none

to hinder down this rock thy safe descent . "

then to that <unk> lip turning , " peace ! " he cried ,

" curs'd wolf ! thy fury inward on thyself

prey , and <unk> thee ! through the dark profound

not without cause he passes . so 't is will'd

on high , there where the great <unk> pour'd

heav'n's vengeance on the first <unk> proud . "

as sails full spread and <unk> with the wind

drop suddenly <unk> , if the <unk> split ;

so to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend .

thus we , descending to the fourth steep <unk> ,

gain'd on the dismal shore , that all the woe

<unk> in of all the universe . ah me !

almighty justice ! in what store thou <unk>

new pains , new <unk> , as i here beheld !

wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this ?

e'en as a billow , on <unk> <unk> ,

against <unk> billow dashing breaks ;

such is the <unk> this wretched race must lead ,

whom more than elsewhere numerous here i found ,

from one side and the other , with loud voice ,

both roll'd on <unk> by main <unk> of their <unk> ,

then smote together , and each one forthwith

roll'd them back <unk> , turning again ,

exclaiming these , " why <unk> thou so fast ? "

those answering , " and why <unk> thou away ? "

so still <unk> their despiteful song ,

they to the opposite point on either hand

<unk> the horrid circle : then arriv'd ,

both turn'd them round , and through the middle space

conflicting met again . at sight whereof

i , stung with grief , thus spake : " o say , my guide !

what race is this ? were these , whose heads are <unk> ,

on our left hand , all sep'rate to the church ? "

he straight replied : " in their first life these all

in mind were so distorted , that they made ,

according to due measure , of their wealth ,

no use . this clearly from their words <unk> ,

which they <unk> forth , at each extremity

arriving of the circle , where their crime

<unk> in kind disparts them . to the church

were separate those , that with no <unk> <unk>

are crown'd , both <unk> and <unk> , o'er whom

av'rice <unk> <unk> <unk> . "

i then : " <unk> such as these some needs must be ,

whom i shall <unk> , that with the <unk>

of these foul sins were stain'd . " he answering thus :

" vain thought <unk> thou . that <unk> life ,

which made them vile before , now makes them dark ,

and to all knowledge <unk> .

<unk> they shall meet in this <unk> <unk> :

these from the tomb with <unk> grasp shall rise ,

those with close - <unk> locks . that ill they gave ,

and ill they kept , hath of the <unk> world

<unk> , and set them at this strife , which needs

no labour'd phrase of mine to set if off .

now <unk> thou see , my son ! how brief , how vain ,

the <unk> committed into <unk> hands ,

for which the human race keep such a <unk> !

not all the gold , that is beneath the moon ,

or ever hath been , of these toil - worn souls

might <unk> rest for one . " i thus rejoin'd :

" my guide ! of thee this also would i learn ;

this fortune , that thou <unk> of , what it is ,

whose talons grasp the blessings of the world ? "

he thus : " o beings blind ! what ignorance

<unk> you ? now my judgment hear and mark .

he , whose <unk> wisdom passes all ,

the <unk> <unk> , gave them <unk> powers

to guide them , so that each part shines to each ,

their light in equal <unk> pour'd .

by similar <unk> he ordain'd

over the world's bright images to <unk> .

<unk> of a <unk> hand

and general <unk> , which at due time

may change the <unk> <unk> of life

from race to race , from one to other's blood ,

beyond <unk> of man's <unk> care :

wherefore one <unk> rises into sway ,

another <unk> , e'en as her will

<unk> , from us conceal'd , as in the <unk>

the serpent train . against her nought avails

your utmost wisdom . she with <unk> <unk> ,

<unk> , and carries on her <unk> , as theirs

the other powers divine . her changes know

<unk> <unk> : by necessity

she is made swift , so <unk> come who <unk>

<unk> in her <unk> . this is she ,

so <unk> e'en by those , whose <unk>

to her is rather praise ; they <unk>

with blame <unk> her , and with evil word ;

but she is blessed , and for that <unk> not :

amidst the other primal beings glad

<unk> on her <unk> , and in her bliss <unk> .

now on our way pass we , to <unk> woe

descending : for each star is falling now ,

that mounted at our entrance , and <unk>

too long our <unk> . " we the circle <unk>

to the next steep , arriving at a well ,

that boiling pours itself down to a foss

<unk> from its source . far <unk> was the wave

than <unk> grain : and we in company

of the' <unk> waters , journeying by their side ,

enter'd , though by a different track , beneath .

into a lake , the stygian nam'd , <unk>

the dismal stream , when it hath reach'd the foot

of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . intent i stood

to gaze , and in the <unk> sunk descried

a miry tribe , all naked , and with looks

<unk> rage . they with their hands alone

struck not , but with the head , the breast , the feet ,

cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs .

the good instructor spake ; " now seest thou , son !

the souls of those , whom anger <unk> .

this too for certain know , that underneath

the water dwells a multitude , whose sighs

into these <unk> make the surface heave ,

as thine eye tells thee <unk> it turn . "

fix'd in the <unk> they say : " sad once were we

in the sweet air made <unk> by the sun ,

carrying a foul and <unk> mist within :

now in these murky <unk> are we sad . "

such dolorous strain they <unk> in their <unk> .

but word distinct can utter none . " our <unk>

thus <unk> we , a <unk> <unk> stretch'd

between the dry <unk> , and the <unk>

of the <unk> pool , turning meanwhile our eyes

downward on those who <unk> its <unk> <unk> ;

nor stopp'd , till to a <unk> low base we came .

my theme pursuing , i relate that ere

we reach'd the lofty <unk> base , our eyes

its height ascended , where two <unk> hung

we mark'd , and from afar another light

return the signal , so remote , that scarce

the eye could <unk> its beam . i turning round

to the deep source of knowledge , thus inquir'd :

" say what this means ? and what that other light

in answer set ? what <unk> doth this ? "

" there on the filthy waters , " he replied ,

" e'en now what next <unk> us mayst thou see ,

if the marsh - <unk> <unk> conceal it not . "

never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd ,

that ran its way so nimbly through the air ,

as a small bark , that through the waves i spied

toward us coming , under the sole sway

of one that <unk> it , who cried aloud :

" art thou arriv'd , fell spirit ? " -- " phlegyas , phlegyas ,

this time thou criest in vain , " my lord replied ;

" no longer shalt thou have us , but while o'er

the <unk> pool we pass . " as one who hears

of some great wrong he hath <unk> , whereat

inly he pines ; so phlegyas inly <unk>

in his fierce ire . my guide descending <unk>

into the skiff , and bade me enter next

close at his side ; nor till my entrance seem'd

the vessel freighted . soon as both <unk> ,

cutting the waves , goes on the ancient prow ,

more deeply than with others it is wont .

while we our course o'er the dead channel held .

one <unk> in mire before me came , and said ;

" who art thou , that thou <unk> ere thine hour ? "

i answer'd : " though i come , i tarry not ;

but who art thou , that art <unk> so foul ? "

" one , as thou seest , who mourn : " he straight replied .

to which i thus : " in mourning and in woe ,

curs'd spirit ! tarry thou . <unk> i know thee well ,

e'en thus in filth <unk> . " then stretch'd he forth

hands to the bark ; whereof my teacher sage

aware , <unk> him back : " away ! down there ;

" to the' other dogs ! " then , with his arms my neck

<unk> , kiss'd my cheek , and spake : " o soul

<unk> disdainful ! blest was she in whom

thou was conceiv'd ! he in the world was one

for <unk> noted ; to his memory

no virtue <unk> its lustre ; even so

here is his <unk> <unk> . there above

how many now hold themselves mighty kings

who here like swine shall <unk> in the mire ,

leaving behind them horrible <unk> ! "

i then : " master ! him fain would i behold

whelm'd in these <unk> , before we quit the lake . "

he thus : " or ever to thy view the shore

be offer'd , satisfied shall be that wish ,

which well deserves <unk> . " scarce his words

were ended , when i saw the miry tribes

set on him with such violence , that yet

for that <unk> i thanks to god and praise

" to <unk> <unk> : " cried they all :

and on himself the <unk> <unk>

turn'd his <unk> fangs . him here we left ,

nor speak i of him more . but on mine ear

sudden a sound of <unk> smote ,

whereat mine eye <unk> i sent abroad .

and thus the good instructor : " now , my son !

draws near the city , that of dis is nam'd ,

with its <unk> <unk> , a mighty throng . "

i thus : " the <unk> already , sir !

there <unk> in the valley i descry ,

gleaming vermilion , as if they from fire

had issu'd . " he replied : " eternal fire ,

that inward burns , shows them with <unk> flame

illum'd ; as in this nether hell thou seest . "

we came within the <unk> deep , that moat

this region <unk> . the walls appear'd

as they were fram'd of iron . we had made

wide circuit , ere a place we reach'd , where loud

the <unk> cried <unk> : " go forth !

the' entrance is here ! " upon the gates i spied

more than a thousand , who of old from heaven

were hurl'd . with <unk> <unk> , " who is this , "

they cried , " that without death first felt , goes through

the regions of the dead ? " my sapient guide

made sign that he for secret parley wish'd ;

whereat their angry scorn <unk> , thus

they spake : " come thou alone ; and let him go

who hath so <unk> enter'd this realm .

alone return he by his witless way ;

if well he know it , let him <unk> . for thee ,

here shalt thou tarry , who through clime so dark

hast been his escort . " now <unk> thee , reader !

what cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words .

i did believe i never should return .

" o my lov'd guide ! who more than seven times

<unk> hast <unk> me , and drawn

from <unk> deep , whereto i stood expos'd ,

desert me not , " i cried , " in this extreme .

and if our onward going be denied ,

together trace we back our steps with speed . "

my liege , who thither had conducted me ,

replied : " fear not : for of our passage none

hath power to <unk> us , by such high

authority permitted . but do thou

expect me here ; meanwhile thy wearied spirit

comfort , and feed with kindly hope , assur'd

i will not leave thee in this lower world . "

this said , departs the sire <unk> ,

and quits me . <unk> i <unk>

at war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts .

i could not hear what <unk> he offer'd them ,

but they <unk> not long , for all at once

to trial fled within . clos'd were the gates

by those our <unk> on the breast

of my liege lord : <unk> he return'd

to me with tardy steps . upon the ground

his eyes were bent , and from his brow <unk>

all confidence , while thus with sighs he spake :

" who hath denied me these <unk> of woe ? "

then thus to me : " that i am <unk> , think

no ground of terror : in this trial i

shall vanquish , use what arts they may within

for hindrance . this their insolence , not new ,

erewhile at gate less secret they display'd ,

which still is without <unk> ; upon its arch

thou <unk> the deadly scroll : and even now

on this side of its entrance , down the steep ,

passing the circles , <unk> , comes

one whose strong might can open us this land . "

the hue , which <unk> dread on my pale cheeks

<unk> , when i saw my guide turn back ,

chas'd that from his which newly they had worn ,

and inwardly restrain'd it . he , as one

who listens , stood attentive : for his eye

not far could lead him through the <unk> air ,

and the thick - gath'ring cloud . " it yet behooves

we win this <unk> " -- thus he began -- " if not --

such aid to us is offer'd . -- oh , how long

me seems it , ere the promis'd help arrive ! "

i noted , how the <unk> of his words

<unk> their beginning ; for the last he spake

<unk> not with the first . but not the less

my fear was at his <unk> ; sith i drew

to import worse perchance , than that he held ,

his <unk> speech . " doth ever any

into this rueful <unk> extreme depth

descend , out of the first degree , whose pain

is <unk> <unk> of sweet hope ? "

thus i <unk> . " <unk> , " he replied ,

" it chances , that among us any makes

this journey , which i <unk> . erewhile 'tis true

once came i here beneath , <unk> by fell

<unk> , <unk> , who compell'd the shades

back to their bodies . no long space my flesh

was naked of me , when within these walls

she made me enter , to draw forth a spirit

from out of <unk> circle . lowest place

is that of all , <unk> , and remov'd

<unk> from heav'n's all - circling orb . the road

full well i know : thou therefore rest secure .

that lake , the noisome <unk> <unk> , round

the city' of grief <unk> , which now

we may not enter without rage . " yet more

he added : but i hold it not in mind ,

for that mine eye toward the lofty <unk>

had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .

where in an instant i beheld <unk>

at once three <unk> <unk> stain'd with blood :

in limb and motion <unk> they seem'd ;

around them <unk> <unk> twisting roll'd

their <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> <unk>

instead of hair , and their fierce temples bound .

he <unk> well the miserable <unk>

who tend the queen of endless woe , thus spake :

" mark thou each dire <unk> . to the left

this is <unk> ; on the right hand she ,

who <unk> , <unk> ; and <unk>

i' th' midst . " this said , in silence he remain'd

their breast they each one <unk> tore ; themselves

smote with their palms , and such shrill clamour rais'd ,

that to the bard i <unk> , suspicion - bound .

" <unk> <unk> : so to <unk>

him shall we change ; " all looking down exclaim'd .

" e'en when by <unk> might assail'd , we took

no ill revenge . " " turn thyself round , and keep

thy count'nance hid ; for if the <unk> dire

be shown , and thou shouldst view it , thy return

upwards would be for ever lost . " this said ,

himself my gentle master turn'd me round ,

nor trusted he my hands , but with his own

he also hid me . ye of intellect

sound and <unk> , mark well the lore conceal'd

under close <unk> of the mystic strain !

and now there came o'er the <unk> waves

loud - <unk> , terrible , a sound that made

either shore tremble , as if of a wind

impetuous , from conflicting vapours sprung ,

that 'gainst some forest <unk> all its might ,

<unk> off the <unk> , beats them down and hurls

afar ; then onward passing proudly sweeps

its whirlwind rage , while beasts and shepherds fly .

mine eyes he loos'd , and spake : " and now direct

thy <unk> <unk> along that ancient foam ,

there , <unk> where the smoke <unk> . " as frogs

before their foe the serpent , through the wave

ply swiftly all , till at the ground each one

lies on a heap ; more than a thousand spirits

destroy'd , so saw i <unk> before one

who pass'd with <unk> feet the stygian sound .

he , from his face <unk> the gross air ,

oft his left hand forth stretch'd , and seem'd alone

by that <unk> wearied . i perceiv'd

that he was sent from heav'n , and to my guide

turn'd me , who signal made that i should stand

<unk> , and bend to him . ah me ! how full

of noble anger seem'd he ! to the gate

he came , and with his <unk> touch'd it , whereat

open without <unk> it flew .

" <unk> of heav'n ! o <unk> race and <unk> ! "

began he on the horrid <unk> standing ,

" whence doth this wild excess of insolence

lodge in you ? wherefore <unk> you 'gainst that will

ne'er <unk> of its end , and which so oft

hath laid on you <unk> of your pangs ?

what profits at the <unk> to but the horn ?

your cerberus , if ye remember , hence

bears still , <unk> of their hair , his throat and maw . "

this said , he turn'd back o'er the filthy way ,

and <unk> to us spake none , but wore

the semblance of a man by other care

beset , and <unk> press'd , than thought of him

who in his presence stands . then we our steps

toward that territory mov'd , secure

after the hallow'd words . we <unk>

there enter'd ; and my mind eager to learn

what state a <unk> like to that might hold ,

i soon as enter'd <unk> mine eye around ,

and see on every part wide - stretching space

<unk> with bitter pain and torment ill .

as where <unk> <unk> on the plains of <unk> ,

or as at <unk> , near <unk> gulf ,

that closes <unk> and <unk> her bounds ,

the place is all thick spread with sepulchres ;

so was it here , save what in horror here

<unk> : for 'midst the <unk> were <unk> flames ,

wherewith <unk> all throughout they burn'd ,

that iron for no <unk> there <unk> needs .

their lids all hung suspended , and beneath

from them forth issu'd lamentable moans ,

such as the sad and tortur'd well might raise .

i thus : " master ! say who are these , <unk>

within these <unk> , of whom distinct we hear

the dolorous sighs ? " he answer thus return'd :

" the arch - <unk> are here , accompanied

by every <unk> their followers ; and much more ,

than thou believest , <unk> are freighted : like

with like is <unk> ; and the <unk>

are different in degrees of heat . " this said ,

he to the right hand turning , on we pass'd

betwixt the afflicted and the <unk> high .

now by a secret <unk> we proceed ,

between the walls , that <unk> the region round ,

and the tormented souls : my master first ,

i close behind his steps . " virtue supreme ! "

i thus began ; " who through these ample <unk>

in circuit <unk> me , even as thou <unk> ,

speak thou , and satisfy my wish . may those ,

who lie within these sepulchres , be seen ?

already all the lids are rais'd , and none

o'er them <unk> watch . " he thus in answer spake

" they shall be <unk> all , what - time they here

from <unk> return'd shall come , and bring

their bodies , which above they now have left .

the <unk> on this part obtain

with <unk> all his followers ,

who with the body make the spirit die .

here therefore <unk> shall be soon

both to the question ask'd , and to the wish ,

which thou <unk> in silence . " i replied :

" i keep not , guide belov'd ! from thee my heart

<unk> , but to shun vain length of words ,

a lesson erewhile taught me by thyself . "

" o tuscan ! thou who through the city of fire

alive art passing , so <unk> of speech !

here <unk> thee stay awhile . thy <unk>

<unk> the place of thy <unk>

to be that noble land , with which perchance

i too <unk> <unk> . " sudden that sound

forth issu'd from a vault , whereat in fear

i somewhat closer to my leader's side

approaching , he thus spake : " what dost thou ? turn .

lo , farinata , there ! who hath himself

<unk> : from his girdle upwards all

expos'd behold him . " on his face was mine

already fix'd ; his breast and forehead there

<unk> , seem'd as in high scorn he held

e'en hell . between the sepulchres to him

my guide thrust me with fearless hands and <unk> ,

this <unk> added : " see thy words be clear ! "

he , soon as there i stood at the <unk> foot ,

ey'd me a space , then in disdainful mood

address'd me : " say , what <unk> were thine ? "

i , willing to obey him , straight <unk>

the whole , nor kept back aught : whence he , his brow

somewhat <unk> , cried : " <unk> were they

adverse to me , my party , and the blood

from whence i sprang : <unk> therefore i abroad

scatter'd them . " " though driv'n out , yet they each time

from all parts , " answer'd i , " return'd ; an art

which yours have shown , they are not <unk> to learn . "

then , <unk> forth from the <unk> <unk> ,

rose from his side a shade , high as the <unk> ,

leaning , methought , upon its <unk> uprais'd .

it look'd around , as eager to explore

if there were other with me ; but perceiving

that fond imagination quench'd , with tears

thus spake : " if thou through this blind <unk> go'st .

led by thy lofty genius and profound ,

where is my son ? and wherefore not with thee ? "

i straight replied : " not of myself i come ,

by him , who there <unk> me , through this clime

conducted , whom perchance guido thy son

had in <unk> . " already had his words

and <unk> of punishment read me his name ,

whence i so fully answer'd . he at once

exclaim'd , up <unk> , " how ! <unk> thou he had ?

no longer lives he ? strikes not on his eye

the blessed <unk> ? " then of some delay

i made ere my reply aware , down fell

supine , not after forth appear'd he more .

meanwhile the other , great of soul , near whom

i yet was station'd , chang'd not count'nance stern ,

nor mov'd the neck , nor bent his <unk> side .

" and if , " <unk> the first discourse ,

" they in this art , " he cried , " small skill have shown ,

that doth torment me more e'en than this bed .

but not yet <unk> times shall be <unk>

her aspect , who reigns here queen of this realm ,

ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art .

so to the pleasant world mayst thou return ,

as thou shalt tell me , why in all their laws ,

against my <unk> this people is so fell ? "

" the <unk> and great havoc , " i replied ,

" that <unk> <unk> flood with crimson stain --

to these <unk> , that in our hallow'd dome

such <unk> ascend . " sighing he shook

the head , then thus resum'd : " in that <unk>

i stood not singly , nor without just cause

<unk> should with the rest have stirr'd ;

but singly there i stood , when by consent

of all , florence had to the ground been <unk> ,

the one who <unk> <unk> the deed . "

" so may thy <unk> find at last <unk> , "

i thus <unk> him , " as thou <unk> this knot ,

which now <unk> my mind . if right i hear ,

ye seem to view <unk> , that which time

leads with him , of the present <unk> . "

" we view , as one who hath an evil sight , "

he answer'd , " <unk> , <unk> far remote :

so much of his large <unk> yet <unk>

the' almighty <unk> ; but when they approach

or <unk> <unk> , our intellect

then wholly fails , nor of your human state

except what others bring us know we aught .

hence therefore mayst thou understand , that all

our knowledge in that instant shall <unk> ,

when on <unk> the <unk> close . "

then <unk> of my fault , and by <unk>

<unk> , i added thus : " now shalt thou say

to him there fallen , that his <unk> still

is to the living join'd ; and bid him know ,

that if from answer silent i abstain'd ,

'twas that my thought was <unk> intent

upon that error , which thy help hath <unk> . "

but now my master <unk> me back

i heard , and with more eager haste besought

the spirit to inform me , who with him

<unk> his lot . he answer thus return'd :

" more than a thousand with me here are laid

within is <unk> , second of that name ,

and the lord <unk> , and of the rest

i speak not . " he , this said , from sight <unk> .

but i my steps towards the ancient bard

<unk> , <unk> on the words

<unk> me such ill . onward he mov'd ,

and thus in going question'd : " whence the' amaze

that holds thy senses wrapt ? " i satisfied

the' <unk> , and the sage enjoin'd me straight :

" let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard

to thee <unk> harm ; and note thou this , "

with his rais'd finger <unk> me take heed ,

" when thou shalt stand before her gracious beam ,

whose bright eye all <unk> , she of thy life

the future tenour will to thee unfold . "

forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet :

we left the wall , and <unk> the middle space

went by a path , that to a valley strikes ;

which e'en thus high <unk> its noisome steam .

upon the utmost verge of a high bank ,

by craggy rocks <unk> round , we came ,

where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd :

and here to shun the horrible excess

of <unk> <unk> , upward cast

from the profound abyss , behind the <unk>

of a great <unk> we stood retir'd ,

whereon this scroll i mark'd : " i have in charge

<unk> <unk> , whom <unk> drew

from the right path . -- ere our descent behooves

we make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,

to the dire breath accustom'd , afterward

regard it not . " my master thus ; to whom

answering i spake : " some <unk> find

that the time past not wholly lost . " he then :

" lo ! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend !

my son ! within these rocks , " he thus began ,

" are three close circles in <unk> plac'd ,

as these which now thou <unk> . each one is full

of spirits accurs'd ; but that the sight alone

<unk> may suffice thee , listen how

and for what cause in <unk> they abide .

" of all <unk> act <unk> in heaven ,

the end is injury ; and all such end

either by force or fraud works other's woe

but fraud , because of man <unk> evil ,

to god is more displeasing ; and beneath

the <unk> are therefore doom'd to' endure

severer pang . the violent <unk>

all the first circle ; and because to force

three <unk> are <unk> , in three <unk>

<unk> within other sep'rate is it fram'd .

to god , his neighbour , and himself , by man

force may be offer'd ; to himself i say

and his <unk> , as thou soon shalt hear

at full . death , violent death , and <unk> wounds

upon his neighbour he <unk> ; and wastes

by <unk> , <unk> , and the flames ,

his substance . <unk> , and each one that smites

in malice , plund'rers , and all <unk> , hence

the torment <unk> of the first round

in different herds . man can do violence

to himself and his own blessings : and for this

he in the second round must aye deplore

with <unk> penitence his crime ,

whoe'er <unk> himself of life and light ,

in <unk> <unk> his <unk> wastes ,

and <unk> there where he should dwell in joy .

to god may force be offer'd , in the heart

<unk> and <unk> his high power ,

and nature with her kindly law <unk> .

and thence the inmost round <unk> with its seal

<unk> and <unk> , and all such as speak

<unk> of the <unk> in their hearts .

" fraud , that in every conscience leaves a sting ,

may be by man <unk> on one , whose trust

he <unk> , or on another who <unk>

strict confidence . seems as the latter way

broke but the <unk> of love which nature makes .

whence in the second circle have their nest

<unk> , <unk> , flatteries ,

theft , falsehood , simony , all who <unk>

to lust , or set their <unk> at <unk> ,

with such vile <unk> as these . the other way

<unk> both nature's general love , and that

which thereto added <unk> gives birth

to <unk> faith . whence in the lesser circle ,

point of the universe , dread seat of dis ,

the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . "

i thus : " instructor , clearly thy discourse

proceeds , <unk> the hideous chasm

and its inhabitants with skill <unk> .

but tell me this : they of the <unk> , fat pool ,

whom the rain beats , or whom the tempest drives ,

or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet ,

wherefore within the city fire - illum'd

are not these punish'd , if god's wrath be on them ?

and if it be not , wherefore in such guise

are they condemned ? " he answer thus return'd :

" wherefore in <unk> <unk> thus thy mind ,

not so accustom'd ? or what other thoughts

<unk> it ? dwell not in thy memory

the words , wherein thy <unk> <unk> <unk>

three <unk> adverse to heav'n's will ,

<unk> , malice , and mad <unk> ,

and how <unk> the least offends

god , and least guilt incurs ? if well thou note

this judgment , and remember who they are ,

without these walls to vain repentance doom'd ,

thou shalt discern why they apart are plac'd

from these fell spirits , and less <unk> pours

justice divine on them its vengeance down . "

" o sun ! who <unk> all <unk> sight ,

thou so <unk> me , when thou <unk> my doubt ,

that ignorance not less than knowledge charms .

yet somewhat turn thee back , " i in these words

continu'd , " where thou saidst , that <unk>

offends celestial goodness ; and this knot

<unk> <unk> . " he thus made reply :

" <unk> , to an attentive ear ,

clearly points out , not in one part alone ,

how <unk> nature takes her course

from the celestial mind and from its art :

and where her laws the <unk> <unk> ,

not many leaves scann'd o'er , <unk> well

thou shalt discover , that your art on her

<unk> follows , as the <unk> treads

in his <unk> step , so that your art

deserves the name of second in descent

from god . these two , if thou <unk> to mind

<unk> holy book , from the beginning

were the right source of life and <unk>

to human kind . but in another path

the <unk> walks ; and nature in herself

and in her <unk> thus he sets at nought ,

<unk> elsewhere his hope . but follow now

my steps on forward journey bent ; for now

the <unk> play with <unk> glance

along the' <unk> , and the <unk> lies all

o'er the <unk> - west ; and onward there a space

is our steep passage down the rocky height . "

the place where to descend the precipice

we came , was rough as alp , and on its verge

such object lay , as every eye would shun .

as is that ruin , which <unk> stream

on this side <unk> struck , <unk> the wave ,

or loos'd by <unk> or for <unk> of <unk> ;

for from the mountain's summit , whence it mov'd

to the low level , so the headlong rock

is shiver'd , that some passage it might give

to him who from above would pass ; e'en such

into the chasm was that descent : and there

at point of the disparted <unk> lay stretch'd

the infamy of crete , <unk> brood

of the feign'd <unk> : and at sight of us

it <unk> itself , as one with rage <unk> .

to him my guide exclaim'd : " perchance thou <unk>

the king of <unk> here , who , in the world

above , thy death <unk> . monster ! avaunt !

he comes not <unk> by thy sister's art ,

but to behold your torments is he come . "

like to a bull , that with impetuous spring

darts , at the moment when the fatal blow

hath struck him , but <unk> to proceed

<unk> on either side ; so saw i plunge

the <unk> ; whereat the sage exclaim'd :

" run to the passage ! while he storms , 't is well

that thou descend . " thus down our road we took

through those <unk> crags , that oft

mov'd underneath my feet , to weight like theirs

<unk> . i pond'ring went , and thus he spake :

" perhaps thy thoughts are of this <unk> steep ,

<unk> by the brute violence , which i

have vanquish'd now . know then , that when i erst

hither descended to the nether hell ,

this rock was not yet fallen . but past doubt

( if well i mark ) not long ere he <unk> ,

who <unk> off from dis the mighty <unk>

of the <unk> circle , then through all its bounds

such trembling seiz'd the deep <unk> and foul ,

i thought the universe was <unk> with love ,

whereby , there are who deem , the world hath oft

been into <unk> turn'd : and in that point ,

here , and elsewhere , that old rock <unk> down .

but fix thine eyes beneath : the river of blood

approaches , in the which all those are steep'd ,

who have by violence injur'd . " o blind lust !

o <unk> wrath ! who so dost <unk> us on

in the brief life , and in the eternal then

thus <unk> <unk> us . i beheld

an ample foss , that in a bow was bent ,

as circling all the plain ; for so my guide

had told . between it and the <unk> base

on <unk> ran <unk> , with keen <unk> arm'd ,

as to the chase they on the earth were wont .

at seeing us descend they each one stood ;

and issuing from the troop , three sped with <unk>

and <unk> weapons chosen first ; of whom

one cried from far : " say to what pain ye come

condemn'd , who down this steep have <unk> ? speak

from whence ye stand , or else the bow i draw . "

to whom my guide : " our answer shall be made

to chiron , there , when nearer him we come .

ill was thy mind , thus ever quick and <unk> . "

then me he touch'd , and spake : " nessus is this ,

who for the fair <unk> <unk> ,

and wrought himself revenge for his own fate .

he in the midst , that on his breast looks down ,

is the great chiron who achilles <unk> ;

that other <unk> , prone to wrath . " around

the foss these go by <unk> , <unk> <unk>

at <unk> spirit <unk> <unk>

from out the blood , more than his guilt allows .

we to those beasts , that rapid <unk> along ,

drew near , when chiron took an arrow forth ,

and with the <unk> push'd back his shaggy beard

to the cheek - bone , then his great mouth to view

<unk> , to his fellows thus exclaim'd :

" are ye aware , that he who comes behind

moves what he touches ? the feet of the dead

are not so wont . " my <unk> guide , who now

stood near his breast , where the two natures join ,

thus made reply : " he is indeed alive ,

and solitary so must needs by me

be shown the gloomy vale , thereto <unk>

by strict necessity , not by delight .

she left her <unk> <unk> in the sky ,

who this new <unk> to my care <unk> .

he is no <unk> , no dark spirit i .

but by that virtue , which <unk> my step

to <unk> so wild a path , grant us , i pray ,

one of thy band , whom we may trust secure ,

who to the ford may lead us , and <unk>

across , him mounted on his back ; for he

is not a spirit that may walk the air . "

then on his right breast turning , chiron thus

to nessus spake : " return , and be their guide .

and if ye chance to cross another troop ,

command them keep aloof . " onward we mov'd ,

the faithful escort by our side , along

the <unk> of the crimson - seething flood ,

whence from those steep'd within loud shrieks <unk> .

some there i mark'd , as high as to their brow

immers'd , of whom the mighty centaur thus :

" these are the souls of <unk> , who were <unk>

to blood and <unk> . here they wail aloud

their <unk> wrongs . here <unk> dwells ,

and <unk> fell , who many a year

of woe wrought for fair <unk> . that brow

whereon the hair so <unk> <unk> hangs ,

is <unk> ; that with <unk> locks

<unk> of <unk> , in the world destroy'd

by his foul step - son . " to the bard rever'd

i <unk> me round , and thus he spake ; " let him

be to thee now first leader , me but next

to him in rank . " then farther on a space

the centaur paus'd , near some , who at the throat

were <unk> from the wave ; and <unk> us

a spirit by itself apart retir'd ,

exclaim'd : " he in god's bosom smote the heart ,

which yet is <unk> on the bank of <unk> . "

a race i next espied , who held the head ,

and even all the <unk> above the stream .

'midst these i many a face remember'd well .

thus <unk> more and more the blood became ,

so that at last it but imbru'd the feet ;

and there our passage lay <unk> the foss .

" as ever on this side the boiling wave

thou seest <unk> , " the centaur said ,

" so on the other , be thou well assur'd ,

it lower still and lower <unk> its bed ,

till in that part it <unk> join ,

where 't is the lot of <unk> to mourn .

there heav'n's stern justice lays <unk> hand

on attila , who was the scourge of earth ,

on <unk> , and on <unk> , and <unk>

tears ever by the seething flood <unk>

from the <unk> , of corneto this ,

<unk> the other nam'd , who fill'd the ways

with violence and war . " this said , he turn'd ,

and <unk> us , alone <unk> the ford .

ere nessus yet had reach'd the other bank ,

we enter'd on a forest , where no track

of steps had worn a way . not <unk> there

the <unk> , but of <unk> hue ; not light

the boughs and <unk> , but with <unk> <unk>

and <unk> thick : <unk> there were none , but thorns

instead , with <unk> fill'd . less sharp than these ,

less <unk> the <unk> , wherein abide

those animals , that <unk> the <unk> fields ,

betwixt corneto and <unk> stream .

here the brute harpies make their nest , the same

who from the <unk> the <unk> band

drove with dire <unk> of their future woe .

broad are their pennons , of the human form

their neck and count'nance , arm'd with talons keen

the feet , and the huge belly <unk> with wings

these sit and wail on the drear mystic wood .

the kind instructor in these words began :

" ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now

i' th' second round , and shalt be , till thou come

upon the horrid sand : look therefore well

around thee , and such things thou shalt behold ,

as would my speech <unk> . " on all sides

i heard sad <unk> <unk> , and none could see

from whom they might have issu'd . in amaze

fast bound i stood . he , as it seem'd , believ'd ,

that i had thought so many voices came

from some amid those <unk> close conceal'd ,

and thus his speech resum'd : " if thou <unk> off

a single <unk> from one of those ill <unk> ,

the thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite . "

thereat a little stretching forth my hand ,

from a great <unk> gather'd i a <unk> ,

and straight the trunk exclaim'd : " why <unk> thou me ? "

then as the dark blood <unk> down its side ,

these words it added : " wherefore <unk> me thus ?

is there no touch of mercy in thy breast ?

men once were we , that now are <unk> here .

thy hand might well have <unk> us , had we been

the souls of serpents . " as a <unk> yet green ,

that burning at one end from the' other <unk>

a <unk> sound , and <unk> with the wind

that <unk> out its way , so burst at once ,

forth from the broken splinter words and blood .

i , <unk> fall the bough , remain'd as one

assail'd by terror , and the sage replied :

" if he , o injur'd spirit ! could have believ'd

what he hath seen but in my verse <unk> ,

he never against thee had stretch'd his hand .

but i , because the thing <unk> <unk> ,

<unk> him to this deed , which even now

myself i rue . but tell me , who thou wast ;

that , for this wrong to do thee some amends ,

in the upper world ( for thither to return

is granted him ) thy fame he may <unk> . "

" that pleasant word of thine , " the trunk replied

" hath so <unk> me , that i from speech

<unk> refrain , wherein if i <unk>

a little longer , in the <unk> <unk> ,

<unk> it not <unk> . i it was , who held

both keys to frederick's heart , and turn'd the <unk> ,

opening and <unk> , with a skill so sweet ,

that besides me , into his inmost breast

scarce any other could <unk> find .

the faith i bore to my high charge was such ,

it <unk> me the life - blood that <unk> my veins .

the harlot , who ne'er turn'd her <unk> eyes

from <unk> <unk> , <unk> vice and <unk>

of <unk> , 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all ;

and to augustus they so spread the flame ,

that my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes .

my soul , disdainful and <unk> , sought

<unk> in death from scorn , and i became ,

just as i was , <unk> toward myself .

by the new <unk> , which fix this <unk> , i swear ,

that never faith i broke to my liege lord ,

who merited such honour ; and of you ,

if any to the world indeed return ,

clear he from wrong my memory , that lies

yet prostrate under <unk> cruel blow . "

first somewhat pausing , till the mournful words

were ended , then to me the bard began :

" <unk> not the time ; but speak and of him ask ,

if more thou wish to learn . " whence i replied :

" question thou him again of whatsoe'er

will , as thou <unk> , content me ; for no power

have i to ask , such <unk> is at my heart . "

he thus resum'd ; " so may he do for thee

freely what thou <unk> , as thou yet

be pleas'd , <unk> spirit ! to declare ,

how in these <unk> joints the soul is tied ;

and whether any ever from such frame

be loosen'd , if thou canst , that also tell . "

thereat the trunk breath'd hard , and the wind soon

chang'd into sounds <unk> like these ;

" briefly ye shall be answer'd . when departs

the fierce soul from the body , by itself

thence torn asunder , to the seventh gulf

by minos doom'd , into the wood it falls ,

no place assign'd , but <unk> chance

hurls it , there <unk> , as a grain of <unk> ,

it rises to a <unk> , <unk> thence

a savage plant . the harpies , on its leaves

then feeding , cause both pain and for the pain

a <unk> to grief . we , as the rest , shall come

for our own <unk> , yet not so that with them

we may again be <unk> ; for what a man

takes from himself it is not just he have .

here we <unk> shall <unk> them ; and throughout

the dismal <unk> our bodies shall be hung ,

each on the wild <unk> of his wretched shade . "

attentive yet to listen to the trunk

we stood , <unk> farther speech , when us

a noise surpris'd , as when a man perceives

the wild boar and the <unk> approach his place

of station'd watch , who of the beasts and boughs

loud <unk> round him hears . and lo ! there came

two naked , torn with <unk> , in headlong flight ,

that they before them broke each fan <unk> th' wood .

" haste now , " the foremost cried , " now haste thee death ! "

the' other , as seem'd , impatient of delay

exclaiming , " <unk> ! not so bent for speed

thy <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> field . "

and then , for that perchance no longer breath

<unk> him , of himself and of a <unk>

one <unk> he made . behind them was the wood

full of black <unk> <unk> , <unk> and fleet ,

as <unk> that have newly <unk> the <unk> .

on him , who <unk> down , they <unk> their fangs ,

and having rent him piecemeal bore away

the tortur'd limbs . my guide then seiz'd my hand ,

and led me to the <unk> , which in vain

mourn'd through its <unk> wounds : " o <unk>

of <unk> <unk> ! what avails it thee , "

it cried , " that of me thou hast made thy screen ?

for thy ill life what blame on me recoils ? "

when o'er it he had paus'd , my master spake :

" say who wast thou , that at so many points

<unk> out with blood thy lamentable speech ? "

he answer'd : " oh , ye spirits : arriv'd in time

to spy the shameful havoc , that from me

my leaves hath <unk> thus , gather them up ,

and at the foot of their sad parent - tree

<unk> lay them . in that city' i dwelt ,

who for the <unk> her first <unk> chang'd ,

whence he for this shall <unk> not with his art

to work her woe : and if there still remain'd not

on arno's passage some faint <unk> of him ,

those citizens , who rear'd once more her walls

upon the ashes left by attila ,

had labour'd without profit of their toil .

i <unk> the fatal <unk> from my own <unk> . "

soon as the <unk> of native land

wrought in my bosom , i the scatter'd leaves

collected , and to him restor'd , who now

was hoarse with utt'rance . to the limit thence

we came , which from the third the second round

<unk> , and where of justice is display'd

<unk> horrible . things then first seen

<unk> to manifest , i tell how next

a plain we reach'd , that from its <unk> bed

each plant <unk> . the mournful wood waves round

its <unk> on all sides , as round the wood

spreads the sad foss . there , on the <unk> edge ,

our steps we <unk> . it was an <unk> wide

of <unk> sand and thick , <unk> most

the soil that erst by cato's foot was <unk> .

vengeance of heav'n ! oh ! how shouldst thou be fear'd

by all , who read what here my eyes beheld !

of naked spirits many a flock i saw ,

all weeping <unk> , to different laws

<unk> : for on the' earth some lay supine ,

some crouching close were seated , others pac'd

<unk> around ; the latter tribe ,

more numerous , those <unk> who beneath

the torment lay , but <unk> in their grief .

o'er all the sand fell slowly <unk> down

<unk> flakes of fire , as flakes of <unk>

on alpine summit , when the wind is <unk> .

as in the torrid <unk> clime , the son

of <unk> saw upon his <unk> band

descending , solid flames , that to the ground

came down : whence he <unk> him with his troop

to <unk> on the soil ; for <unk> thus

the vapour was extinguish'd , while alone ;

so fell the eternal fiery flood , wherewith

the <unk> <unk> underneath , as under <unk>

the <unk> , doubly to <unk> the pain .

<unk> was the play of wretched hands ,

now this , now that way glancing , to <unk> off

the heat , still falling fresh . i thus began :

" instructor ! thou who all things <unk> ,

except the <unk> demons , that rush'd forth

to <unk> our entrance at the gate , say who

is yon huge spirit , that , as seems , <unk> not

the burning , but lies <unk> in proud scorn ,

as by the <unk> tempest <unk> ? "

straight he himself , who was aware i ask'd

my guide of him , exclaim'd : " such as i was

when living , dead such now i am . if <unk>

weary his <unk> out , from whom in ire

he <unk> the <unk> , that at my last day

<unk> me , if the rest be weary out

at their black <unk> <unk> by turns

in <unk> , while he cries aloud ;

" help , help , good <unk> ! " as erst he cried

in the <unk> warfare , and the <unk>

<unk> he full <unk> at me with all his might ,

he never should <unk> a sweet revenge . "

then thus my guide , in accent higher rais'd

than i before had heard him : " <unk> !

thou art more punish'd , in that this thy pride

lives yet <unk> : no torrent , save thy rage ,

were to thy fury pain <unk> full . "

next turning round to me with milder lip

he spake : " this of the seven kings was one ,

who <unk> the theban walls with <unk> , and held ,

as still he seems to hold , god in disdain ,

and sets his high <unk> at nought .

but , as i told him , his despiteful mood

is <unk> well suits the breast that wears it .

follow me now ; and look thou set not yet

thy foot in the <unk> sand , but to the wood

keep ever close . " <unk> on we pass'd

to where there <unk> from the <unk> bound

a little brook , whose <unk> wave yet <unk>

my hair with horror . as the <unk> , that <unk>

from <unk> , to be <unk> out

among the <unk> women ; so ran this

down through the sand , its bottom and each bank

stone - <unk> , and either <unk> at its side ,

whereon i straight perceiv'd our passage lay .

" of all that i have shown thee , since that gate

we enter'd first , whose threshold is to none

denied , nought else so worthy of regard ,

as is this river , has thine eye discern'd ,

o'er which the <unk> <unk> all is quench'd . "

so spake my guide ; and i him thence besought ,

that having giv'n me <unk> to know ,

the food he too would give , that hunger crav'd .

" in midst of ocean , " forthwith he began ,

" a <unk> country lies , which crete is nam'd ,

under whose monarch in old times the world

liv'd pure and chaste . a mountain rises there ,

call'd <unk> , joyous once with leaves and streams ,

<unk> now like a <unk> thing .

it was the spot which <unk> , <unk> spouse ,

chose for the secret <unk> of her son ;

and better to conceal him , <unk> in <unk>

his infant cries . within the mount , upright

an ancient form there stands and huge , that turns

his shoulders towards <unk> , and at rome

as in his <unk> looks . of <unk> gold

his head is shap'd , pure silver are the breast

and arms ; thence to the middle is of <unk> .

and downward all beneath well - <unk> <unk> ,

save the right foot of <unk> <unk> , on which

than on the other more erect he stands ,

each part except the gold , is rent throughout ;

and from the <unk> tears <unk> , which join'd

<unk> to that <unk> . they in their course

thus far <unk> down the rock

form acheron , and <unk> , and phlegethon ;

then by this <unk> channel passing hence

beneath , e'en to the lowest depth of all ,

form there <unk> , of whose lake ( thyself

shall see it ) i here give thee no account . "

then i to him : " if from our world this <unk>

be thus deriv'd ; wherefore to us but now

<unk> it at this edge ? " he straight replied :

" the place , thou know'st , is round ; and though great part

thou have already pass'd , still to the left

descending to the nethermost , not yet

hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb .

wherefore if aught of new to us appear ,

it needs not bring up wonder in thy looks . "

then i again inquir'd : " where <unk> the streams

of phlegethon and lethe ? for of one

thou tell'st not , and the other of that <unk> ,

thou <unk> , is form'd . " he answer thus return'd :

" <unk> thy <unk> all well pleas'd i hear .

yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd

one thou <unk> . lethe thou shalt see ,

but not within this hollow , in the place ,

whither to <unk> themselves the spirits go ,

whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd . "

he added : " time is now we quit the wood .

look thou my steps pursue : the margins give

safe passage , <unk> by the flames ;

for over them all vapour is <unk> . "

one of the solid margins bears us now

<unk> in the mist , that from the stream

arising , <unk> o'er , and saves from fire

both <unk> and water . as the <unk> rear

their mound , 'twixt <unk> and <unk> , to chase back

the ocean , fearing his <unk> tide

that drives toward them , or the <unk> theirs

along the <unk> , to <unk> their <unk>

and <unk> , ere the <unk> <unk> be felt

on <unk> top ; such were the <unk> ,

so fram'd , though not in height or <unk> to these

made equal , by the master , whosoe'er

he was , that rais'd them here . we from the wood

were not so far remov'd , that turning round

i might not have discern'd it , when we met

a troop of spirits , who came beside the pier .

they each one ey'd us , as at <unk>

one eyes another under a new moon ,

and toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen ,

as an old <unk> at his <unk> eye .

thus <unk> explor'd by all the tribe ,

i was <unk> of one , who by the <unk>

caught me , and cried , " what wonder have we here ! "

and i , when he to me outstretch'd his arm ,

<unk> fix'd my ken on his <unk> looks ,

that although <unk> with fire , they <unk> not

but i remember'd him ; and towards his face

my hand inclining , answer'd : " sir ! brunetto !

" and art thou here ? " he thus to me : " my son !

oh let it not <unk> thee , if brunetto

<unk> but a little space with thee

turn back , and leave his fellows to proceed . "

i thus to him replied : " much as i can ,

i thereto pray thee ; and if thou be willing ,

that i here seat me with thee , i consent ;

his leave , with whom i journey , first obtain'd . "

" o son ! " said he , " whoever of this throng

one instant stops , lies then a hundred years ,

no fan to <unk> him , when the fire

smites <unk> . pass thou therefore on . i close

will at thy <unk> walk , and then <unk>

my troop , who go mourning their endless doom . "

i <unk> not from the path descend to tread

on equal ground with him , but held my head

bent down , as one who walks in <unk> guise .

" what chance or destiny , " thus he began ,

" ere the last day <unk> thee here below ?

and who is this , that shows to thee the way ? "

" there up aloft , " i answer'd , " in the life

serene , i <unk> in a valley lost ,

before mine age had to its <unk> reach'd .

but <unk> - <unk> i left it : then once more

into that vale returning , him i met ;

and by this path <unk> he leads me back . "

" if thou , " he answer'd , " follow but thy star ,

thou canst not miss at last a <unk> haven :

unless in <unk> days my judgment <unk> .

and if my fate so early had not <unk> ,

seeing the <unk> thus <unk> to thee , i

had <unk> giv'n thee comfort in thy work .

but that <unk> and malignant race ,

who in old times came down from fesole ,

ay and still <unk> of their rough mountain - <unk> ,

will for thy good deeds <unk> thee <unk> .

nor wonder ; for amongst ill - <unk> <unk>

it suits not the sweet <unk> - tree lay her fruit .

old fame reports them in the world for blind ,

<unk> , <unk> , proud . look to it well :

take heed thou <unk> thee of their ways . for thee

thy fortune hath such honour in <unk> ,

that thou by either party shalt be crav'd

with hunger keen : but be the fresh herb far

from the <unk> <unk> . the herd of fesole

may of themselves make <unk> , not touch the plant ,

if any such yet spring on their rank bed ,

in which the holy seed revives , <unk>

from those true romans , who still there remain'd ,

when it was made the nest of so much ill . "

" were all my wish <unk> , " i straight replied ,

" thou from the <unk> of man's nature yet

<unk> not been <unk> forth ; for in my mind

is fix'd , and now strikes full upon my heart

the <unk> , benign , <unk> image , such

as thine was , when so lately thou didst teach me

the way for man to win <unk> ;

and how i priz'd the lesson , it behooves ,

that , long as life endures , my tongue should speak ,

what of my fate thou tell'st , that <unk> i down :

and with another <unk> to <unk> on

for her i keep it , the celestial dame ,

who will know all , if i to her arrive .

this only would i have thee clearly note :

that so my conscience have no <unk> against me ;

do fortune as she <unk> , i stand prepar'd .

not new or strange such earnest to mine ear .

speed fortune then her wheel , as <unk> her best ,

the <unk> his <unk> ; all things have their course . "

thereat my sapient guide upon his right

turn'd himself back , then look'd at me and spake :

" he listens to good purpose who takes note . "

i not the less still on my way proceed ,

<unk> with brunetto , and inquire

who are most known and chief among his tribe .

" to know of some is well ; " thus he replied ,

" but of the rest silence may best <unk> .

time would not serve us for <unk> so long .

in brief i tell thee , that all these were <unk> ,

men of great <unk> and no less renown ,

by one same sin <unk> in the world .

with them is <unk> , and <unk> son

<unk> herds among that wretched throng :

and , if the wish of so <unk> a <unk>

possess'd thee , him thou also <unk> have seen ,

who by the <unk> servant was <unk>

from arno's seat to <unk> , where

his ill - <unk> <unk> he left . i more would <unk> ,

but must from farther speech and onward way

<unk> <unk> , for yonder i behold

a mist new - risen on the <unk> plain .

a company , with whom i may not sort ,

approaches . i commend my <unk> to thee ,

wherein i yet <unk> ; my sole request . "

this said he turn'd , and seem'd as one of those ,

who o'er <unk> <unk> <unk> their speed

for the green mantle , and of them he seem'd ,

not he who <unk> but who gains the <unk> .

now came i where the water's din was heard ,

as down it fell into the other round ,

<unk> like the <unk> of swarming <unk> :

when forth together issu'd from a troop ,

that pass'd beneath the fierce <unk> storm ,

three spirits , running swift . they towards us came ,

and each one cried aloud , " oh do thou stay !

whom by the fashion of thy <unk> we deem

to be some <unk> of our evil land . "

ah me ! what wounds i mark'd upon their limbs ,

<unk> and old , <unk> by the flames !

e'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet .

attentive to their cry my teacher paus'd ,

and turn'd to me his visage , and then spake ;

" <unk> now ! our courtesy these merit well :

and were 't not for the nature of the place ,

whence <unk> the fiery darts , i should have said ,

that haste had better suited thee than them . "

they , when we stopp'd , resum'd their ancient wail ,

and soon as they had reach'd us , all the three

whirl'd round together in one restless wheel .

as naked <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> ,

are wont intent to watch their place of hold

and vantage , ere in closer strife they meet ;

thus each one , as he <unk> , his countenance

at me <unk> , so that opposite

the neck mov'd ever to the <unk> feet .

" if misery of this drear wilderness , "

thus one began , " added to our sad cheer

and <unk> , do call forth scorn on us

and our <unk> , let our great renown

incline thee to inform us who thou art ,

that dost imprint with living feet <unk>

the soil of hell . he , in whose track thou see'st

my steps pursuing , naked though he be

and reft of all , was of more high estate

than thou believest ; <unk> of the chaste

<unk> , him they <unk> call'd ,

who in his <unk> many a noble act

<unk> , both by his wisdom and his <unk> .

the other , next to me that beats the sand ,

is <unk> , name <unk> well ,

in the' upper world , of honour ; and myself

who in this torment do <unk> with them ,

am <unk> , whom , past doubt , my wife

of savage <unk> , more than aught beside

hath to this evil brought . " if from the fire

i had been <unk> , down amidst them straight

i then had cast me , nor my guide , i deem ,

would have restrain'd my going ; but that fear

of the dire burning vanquish'd the desire ,

which made me eager of their wish'd <unk> .

i then began : " not scorn , but grief much more ,

such as long time alone can cure , your doom

fix'd deep within me , soon as this my lord

spake words , whose tenour taught me to expect

that such a race , as ye are , was at hand .

i am a <unk> of yours , who still

<unk> have utter'd , and have heard

your deeds and names renown'd . leaving the <unk>

for the sweet fruit i go , that a sure guide

hath promis'd to me . but behooves , that far

as to the centre first i downward tend . "

" so may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs , "

he answer straight return'd ; " and so thy fame

shine bright , when thou art gone ; as thou shalt tell ,

if courtesy and <unk> , as they wont ,

dwell in our city , or have vanish'd clean ?

for one amidst us late condemn'd to wail ,

<unk> , yonder <unk> with his <unk> ,

grieves us no little by the <unk> he brings . "

" an <unk> multitude and sudden gains ,

pride and excess , o florence ! have in thee

<unk> , so that now in tears thou <unk> ! "

thus cried i with my face uprais'd , and they

all three , who for an answer took my words ,

look'd at each other , as men look when truth

comes to their ear . " if thou at other times , "

they all at once rejoin'd , " so easily

satisfy those , who question , happy thou ,

<unk> with words , so apt to speak thy thought !

wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime ,

returning to behold the <unk> stars ,

when thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past ,

see that of us thou speak among mankind . "

this said , they broke the circle , and so swift

fled , that as <unk> seem'd their nimble feet .

not in so short a time might one have said

" <unk> , " as they had vanish'd . straight my guide

pursu'd his track . i <unk> ; and small space

had we pass'd onward , when the water's sound

was now so near at hand , that we had scarce

heard one <unk> speech for the loud din .

e'en as the river , that holds on its course

<unk> , from the mount of <unk> ,

on the left side of apennine , toward

the <unk> , which <unk> higher up

they call , ere it descend into the vale ,

at <unk> by that name no longer known ,

<unk> o'er saint <unk> , roll'd on

from the' alpine summit down a precipice ,

where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads ;

thus downward from a craggy steep we found ,

that this dark wave resounded , <unk> loud ,

so that the ear its clamour soon had <unk> .

i had a cord that <unk> my girdle round ,

wherewith i erst had thought fast bound to take

the painted <unk> . this when i had all

<unk> from me ( so my master bade )

i gather'd up , and stretch'd it forth to him .

then to the right he turn'd , and from the brink

standing few paces distant , cast it down

into the deep abyss . " and somewhat strange , "

thus to myself i spake , " signal so strange

<unk> , which my guide with earnest eye

thus follows . " ah ! what <unk> must men use

with those who look not at the deed alone ,

but spy into the thoughts with <unk> skill !

" quickly shall come , " he said , " what i expect ,

thine eye discover quickly , that whereof

thy thought is dreaming . " ever to that truth ,

which but the semblance of a falsehood wears ,

a man , if <unk> , should <unk> his lip ;

since , although blameless , he incurs <unk> .

but silence here were vain ; and by these notes

which now i sing , reader ! i swear to thee ,

so may they favour find to <unk> times !

that through the gross and murky air i spied

a shape come swimming up , that might have <unk>

the <unk> heart with wonder , in such guise

as one returns , who hath been down to loose

an <unk> grappled fast against some rock ,

or to aught else that in the <unk> wave lies ,

who upward <unk> close draws in his feet .

" lo ! the fell monster with the deadly sting !

who passes mountains , breaks through <unk> walls

and firm <unk> <unk> , and with his filth

<unk> all the world ! " thus me my guide address'd ,

and <unk> him , that he should come to shore ,

near to the <unk> <unk> utmost edge .

forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd ,

his head and upper part expos'd on land ,

but laid not on the shore his <unk> train .

his face the semblance of a just man's wore ,

so kind and gracious was its outward cheer ;

the rest was serpent all : two shaggy claws

reach'd to the <unk> , and the back and breast ,

and either side , were painted o'er with <unk>

and <unk> . colours <unk> more

nor <unk> nor <unk> e'er on <unk> of state

with <unk> <unk> wove ,

nor spread <unk> o'er her <unk> <unk> .

as ofttimes a light skiff , <unk> to the shore ,

stands part in water , part upon the land ;

or , as where dwells the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,

the <unk> <unk> <unk> for his prey ;

so on the <unk> , that <unk> the sand with rock ,

<unk> <unk> the fiend of evil . in the <unk>

glancing , his tail upturn'd its <unk> fork ,

with sting like <unk> arm'd . then thus my guide :

" now need our way must turn few steps apart ,

far as to that ill beast , who <unk> there . "

thereat toward the right our downward course

we shap'd , and , better to escape the flame

and burning <unk> , ten paces on the verge

proceeded . soon as we to him arrive ,

a little further on mine eye beholds

a tribe of spirits , seated on the sand

near the wide chasm . forthwith my master spake :

" that to the full thy knowledge may <unk>

of all this round contains , go now , and mark

the <unk> these wear : but hold not long discourse .

till thou <unk> , i with him meantime

will parley , that to us he may vouchsafe

the aid of his strong shoulders . " thus alone

yet forward on the' extremity i pac'd

of that seventh circle , where the mournful tribe

were seated . at the eyes forth <unk> their pangs .

against the vapours and the torrid soil

<unk> their shifting hands they <unk> .

thus use the dogs in summer still to ply

their jaws and feet by turns , when <unk> sore

by <unk> , or flies , or <unk> swarming round .

<unk> the <unk> of some , who lay

beneath the <unk> of that dolorous fire ,

one of them all i knew not ; but perceiv'd ,

that pendent from his neck each bore a pouch

with colours and with <unk> various mark'd ,

on which it seem'd as if their eye did feed .

and when amongst them looking round i came ,

a <unk> purse i saw with azure wrought ,

that wore a <unk> countenance and port .

then still my sight pursuing its <unk> ,

another i beheld , than blood more red .

a <unk> <unk> of <unk> wing than <unk> .

and one , who bore a fat and azure swine

<unk> on his white <unk> , <unk> me thus :

" what dost thou in this deep ? go now and know ,

since yet thou <unk> , that my neighbour here

<unk> on my left shall sit .

a <unk> with these <unk> am i .

ofttimes they thunder in mine ears , exclaiming

<unk> haste that noble <unk> ! he who the pouch

with the three <unk> will bring ! ' " this said , he writh'd

the mouth , and <unk> the tongue out , like an <unk>

that <unk> his nostrils . i , lest longer stay

he ill might brook , who bade me stay not long ,

backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd .

my guide already seated on the haunch

of the fierce animal i found ; and thus

he me <unk> . " be thou stout ; be bold .

down such a steep flight must we now descend !

mount thou before : for that no power the tail

may have to harm thee , i will be i' th' midst . "

as one , who hath an <unk> fit so near ,

his nails already are turn'd <unk> , and he

<unk> all o'er , if he but eye the shade ;

such was my cheer at hearing of his words .

but shame soon <unk> her <unk> , who makes

the servant bold in presence of his lord .

i <unk> me upon those shoulders huge ,

and would have said , but that the words to aid

my purpose came not , " look thou <unk> me firm ! "

but he whose succour then not first i prov'd ,

soon as i mounted , in his arms aloft ,

embracing , held me up , and thus he spake :

" geryon ! now move thee ! be thy wheeling <unk>

of ample circuit , easy thy descent .

think on th' <unk> burden thou <unk> . "

as a small vessel , <unk> out from land ,

her <unk> quits ; so thence the monster loos'd ,

and when he felt himself at large , turn'd round

there where the breast had been , his <unk> tail .

thus , like an <unk> , outstretch'd at length he <unk> ,

gath'ring the air up with <unk> claws .

not greater was the dread when <unk>

the reins let drop at <unk> , whence high heaven ,

whereof <unk> yet appear , was wrapt in flames ;

nor when ill - fated <unk> perceiv'd ,

by <unk> of the <unk> wax ,

the trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins ,

his sire exclaiming loud , " ill way thou <unk> ! "

than was my dread , when round me on each part

the air i view'd , and other object none

save the fell beast . he slowly <unk> , wheels

his downward motion , <unk> of me ,

but that the wind , arising to my face ,

<unk> on me from below . now on our right

i heard the <unk> beneath us leap

with hideous crash ; whence <unk> down to' explore ,

new terror i conceiv'd at the steep plunge :

for flames i saw , and wailings smote mine ear :

so that all trembling close i <unk> my limbs ,

and then distinguish'd , <unk> before ,

by the dread torments that on every side

drew nearer , how our downward course we wound .

as falcon , that hath long been on the wing ,

but <unk> nor bird hath seen , while in <unk>

the <unk> cries , " ah me ! thou <unk> to earth ! "

wearied descends , and swiftly down the sky

in many an <unk> wheels , then lighting sits

at <unk> from his lord in angry mood ;

so geryon lighting <unk> us on foot

low down at base of the deep - <unk> rock ,

and , of his burden there <unk> , forthwith

sprang forward , like an arrow from the <unk> .

there is a place within the <unk> of hell

call'd malebolge , all of rock dark - stain'd

with hue <unk> , e'en as the steep

that round it circling winds . right in the midst

of that <unk> region , <unk>

a <unk> gulf profound , whereof the frame

due time shall tell . the circle , that remains ,

throughout its round , between the gulf and base

of the high craggy banks , successive <unk>

ten <unk> , in its hollow bottom sunk .

as where to <unk> the walls , full many a foss

<unk> some <unk> castle , sure <unk>

<unk> to the space within , so here

were <unk> these ; and as like <unk>

e'en from their threshold to the brink without ,

are <unk> with <unk> ; from the <unk> low base

thus flinty <unk> advanc'd , that <unk> the <unk>

and <unk> , struck onward far as to the gulf ,

that in one bound collected <unk> them off .

such was the place , wherein we found <unk>

from <unk> back <unk> . the bard to left

held on his way , and i behind him mov'd .

on our right hand new misery i saw ,

new pains , new <unk> of wrath ,

that swarming <unk> the first chasm . below

were naked sinners . <unk> they came ,

<unk> our faces from the middle point ,

with us beyond but with a larger <unk> .

e'en thus the romans , when the year returns

of <unk> , with better speed to <unk>

the <unk> multitudes , their means devise

for such as pass the bridge ; that on one side

all front toward the castle , and approach

saint peter's <unk> , on th' other towards the mount .

each <unk> way along the <unk> rock ,

<unk> demons i beheld , with <unk> huge ,

that on their back <unk> smote .

ah ! how they made them bound at the first <unk> !

none for the second waited nor the third .

meantime as on i pass'd , one met my sight

whom soon as view'd ; " of him , " cried i , " not yet

mine eye hath had his fill . " with fixed gaze

i therefore scann'd him . straight the teacher kind

paus'd with me , and <unk> i should walk

backward a space , and the tormented spirit ,

who thought to hide him , bent his visage down .

but it avail'd him nought ; for i exclaim'd :

" thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground ,

unless thy <unk> do <unk> thee much ,

<unk> art thou . but what brings thee

into this bitter <unk> ? " he replied :

" <unk> i answer to thy words .

but thy clear speech , that to my mind <unk>

the world i once <unk> , <unk> me .

know then 'twas i who led fair <unk>

to do the <unk> will , <unk> fame

the shameful tale have <unk> . nor alone

bologna hither <unk> me to mourn

rather with us the place is so <unk>

that not so many tongues this day are taught ,

betwixt the <unk> and <unk> stream ,

to answer <unk> in their <unk> phrase .

and if of that <unk> proof thou need ,

remember but our craving <unk> for gold . "

him speaking thus , a demon with his <unk>

struck , and exclaim'd , " away ! <unk> ! here

women are none for <unk> . " forthwith i join'd

my escort , and few paces thence we came

to where a rock forth issued from the bank .

that easily ascended , to the right

upon its splinter turning , we depart

from those eternal <unk> . when arriv'd ,

where underneath the <unk> arch lets pass

the <unk> souls : " pause here , " the teacher said ,

" and let these others miserable , now

strike on thy ken , faces not yet beheld ,

for that together they with us have <unk> . "

from the old bridge we ey'd the <unk> , who came

from th' other side towards us , like the rest ,

<unk> from the <unk> . my gentle guide ,

by me <unk> , thus his speech resum'd :

" behold that lofty shade , who this way <unk> ,

and seems too woe - <unk> to drop a tear .

how yet the <unk> aspect he <unk> !

jason is he , whose skill and <unk> won

the <unk> from <unk> . to the <unk> isle

his passage thither led him , when those bold

and <unk> women had <unk> all their males .

there he with <unk> and fair <unk> words

<unk> beguil'd , a virgin young ,

who first had all the rest herself beguil'd .

<unk> he left her there <unk> .

such is the guilt <unk> him to this pain .

here too <unk> <unk> are <unk> .

all bear him company , who like deceit

to his have practis'd . and thus much to know

of the first vale suffice thee , and of those

whom its keen torments urge . " now had we come

where , <unk> the next pier , the <unk> path

<unk> its shoulders to another arch .

hence in the second chasm we heard the <unk> ,

who <unk> in low <unk> sounds ,

with wide - stretch'd nostrils <unk> , and on themselves

<unk> with their palms . upon the banks a <unk>

from the foul steam <unk> , <unk> hung ,

that held sharp <unk> with the sight and <unk> .

so hollow is the depth , that from no part ,

save on the summit of the rocky <unk> ,

could i <unk> aught . thus far we came ;

and thence i saw , within the foss below ,

a crowd immers'd in <unk> , that appear'd

<unk> of the human body . there beneath

<unk> with eye <unk> , i mark'd

one with his head so <unk> , 't were hard to deem ,

if he were <unk> or <unk> . loud he cried :

" why <unk> thus <unk> more on me ,

than on these other filthy <unk> , thy ken ? "

" because if true my <unk> , " i replied ,

" i heretofore have seen thee with dry locks ,

and thou <unk> art of <unk> sprung .

therefore than all the rest i scan thee more . "

then <unk> on his brain these words he spake :

" me thus low down my flatteries have sunk ,

wherewith i ne'er enough could <unk> my tongue . "

my leader thus : " a little further <unk>

thy face , that thou the visage well mayst note

of that <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,

who there doth rend her with <unk> nails ,

now crouching down , now risen on her feet .

" <unk> is this , the harlot , whose false lip

answer'd her <unk> <unk> that ask'd ,

<unk> me much ! ' -- <unk> rather wondrously , '

and seeing this here <unk> be our view . "

woe to thee , <unk> <unk> ! woe to you ,

his wretched followers ! who the things of god ,

which should be <unk> unto goodness , them ,

<unk> as ye are , do <unk>

for gold and silver in <unk> !

now must the trumpet sound for you , since yours

is the third chasm . upon the following vault

we now had mounted , where the rock <unk>

<unk> o'er the centre of the foss .

wisdom supreme ! how <unk> the art ,

which thou dost manifest in heaven , in earth ,

and in the evil world , how just a <unk>

<unk> by thy virtue unto all !

i saw the livid stone , throughout the sides

and in its bottom full of <unk> ,

all equal in their <unk> , and <unk> each ,

nor ample less nor larger they appear'd

than in saint <unk> fair dome of me belov'd

those fram'd to hold the pure <unk> streams ,

one of the which i brake , some few years past ,

to save a <unk> infant ; and be this

a seal to <unk> whoever <unk>

the <unk> of my deed . from out the mouth

of every one , <unk> a <unk> feet

and of the legs high upward as the <unk>

the rest beneath was hid . on either foot

the <unk> were burning , whence the <unk> joints

<unk> with such violent motion , as had <unk>

asunder <unk> or twisted <unk> . as flame ,

feeding on unctuous matter , glides along

the surface , scarcely touching where it moves ;

so here , from <unk> to point , <unk> the flames .

" master ! say who is he , than all the rest

glancing in <unk> agony , on whom

a <unk> flame doth prey ? " i thus inquir'd .

" if thou be willing , " he replied , " that i

carry thee down , where least the slope bank falls ,

he of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs . "

i then : " as pleases thee to me is best .

thou art my lord ; and know'st that ne'er i quit

thy will : what silence <unk> that knowest thou . "

thereat on the fourth pier we came , we turn'd ,

and on our left descended to the depth ,

a narrow strait and <unk> close .

nor from his side my leader set me down ,

till to his <unk> he brought , whose limb

<unk> <unk> his pang . " whoe'er thou art ,

sad spirit ! thus revers'd , and as a <unk>

driv'n in the soil ! " i in these words began ,

" if thou be able , utter forth thy voice . "

there stood i like the friar , that doth <unk>

a wretch for <unk> doom'd , who e'en when fix'd ,

<unk> him back , whence death awhile delays .

he shouted : " <unk> ! already standest there ?

already standest there , o <unk> !

by many a year the writing play'd me false .

so early dost thou <unk> with the wealth ,

for which thou <unk> not in guile to take

the lovely lady , and then <unk> her ? "

i felt as those who , piercing not the <unk>

of answer made them , stand as if expos'd

in mockery , nor know what to reply ,

when virgil thus <unk> : " tell him quick ,

i am not he , not he , whom thou believ'st . "

and i , as was enjoin'd me , straight replied .

that heard , the spirit all did <unk> his feet ,

and sighing next in woeful accent spake :

" what then of me <unk> ? if to know

so much <unk> thee , who i am , that thou

hast therefore down the bank descended , learn

that in the mighty mantle i was <unk> ,

and of a she - bear was indeed the son ,

so eager to advance my <unk> , that there

my having in my purse above i stow'd ,

and here myself . under my head are dragg'd

the rest , my <unk> in the guilt

of simony . stretch'd at their length they lie

along an opening in the rock . 'midst them

i also low shall fall , soon as he comes ,

for whom i took thee , when so <unk>

i question'd . but already longer time

hath pass'd , since my souls kindled , and i thus

upturn'd have stood , than is his doom to stand

planted with fiery feet . for after him ,

one yet of deeds more <unk> shall arrive ,

from forth the west , a <unk> without law ,

fated to <unk> both his form and mine .

he a new jason shall be call'd , of whom

in <unk> we read ; and favour such

as to that priest his king <unk> show'd ,

shall be of <unk> monarch shown to him . "

i know not if i here too far <unk> ,

but in this strain i answer'd : " tell me now ,

what <unk> from <unk> . peter at the first

our lord <unk> , when he <unk> the keys

into his charge ? surely he ask'd no more

but , follow me ! nor peter nor the rest

or gold or silver of <unk> took ,

when lots were cast upon the <unk> place

of the condemned soul . abide thou then ;

thy punishment of right is merited :

and look thou well to that ill - <unk> <unk> ,

which against <unk> thy <unk> <unk> .

if reverence of the keys restrain'd me not ,

which thou in <unk> time didst hold , i yet

severer speech might use . your <unk>

<unk> the world with mourning , under foot

<unk> the good , and <unk> bad men up .

of shepherds , like to you , th' <unk>

was ware , when her , who sits upon the waves ,

with kings in filthy <unk> he beheld ,

she who with seven heads <unk> at her birth ,

and from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,

long as her spouse in virtue took delight .

of gold and silver ye have made your god ,

<unk> wherein from the <unk> ,

but he that <unk> one , a hundred ye ?

ah , constantine ! to how much ill gave birth ,

not thy <unk> , but that <unk> <unk> ,

which the first <unk> father gain'd from thee ! "

meanwhile , as thus i <unk> , he , whether wrath

or conscience smote him , violent <unk>

<unk> on either sole . i do believe

my teacher well was pleas'd , with so <unk>

a lip , he listen'd ever to the sound

of the true words i utter'd . in both arms

he caught , and to his bosom lifting me

upward <unk> the way of his descent .

nor weary of his weight he press'd me close ,

till to the summit of the rock we came ,

our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier .

his <unk> burden there <unk> he plac'd

upon the rugged rock and steep , a path

not easy for the <unk> <unk> to mount .

thence to my view another vale appear'd

and now the verse proceeds to torments new ,

fit <unk> of this the <unk> strain

of the first song , whose <unk> theme <unk>

the spirits whelm'd in woe . earnest i look'd

into the depth , that open'd to my view ,

<unk> with tears of anguish , and beheld

a tribe , that came along the hollow vale ,

in silence weeping : such their step as walk

<unk> chanting <unk> <unk> on earth .

as on them more direct mine eye descends ,

each wondrously seem'd to be revers'd

at the neck - bone , so that the countenance

was from the reins <unk> : and because

none might before him look , they were compell'd

to' advance with backward <unk> . thus one perhaps

hath been by force of <unk> clean <unk> ,

but i ne'er saw it nor believe it so .

now , reader ! think within thyself , so god

fruit of thy reading give thee ! how i long

could keep my visage dry , when i beheld

near me our form distorted in such guise ,

that on the hinder parts fall'n from the face

the tears down - <unk> roll'd . against a rock

i <unk> and wept , so that my guide exclaim'd :

" what , and art thou too witless as the rest ?

here pity most doth <unk> herself alive ,

when she is dead . what guilt <unk> his ,

who with heaven's judgment in his <unk> <unk> ?

raise up thy head , raise up , and see the man ,

before whose eyes earth <unk> in thebes , when all

cried out , <unk> , whither <unk> ?

<unk> <unk> thou the war ? ' he not the less

fell <unk> far as to minos down ,

whose grapple none <unk> . lo ! how he makes

the breast his shoulders , and who once too far

before him wish'd to see , now backward looks ,

and treads <unk> his path . <unk> note ,

who semblance chang'd , when <unk> he became

of <unk> , through every limb transform'd , and then

once more behov'd him with his <unk> to strike

the two <unk> serpents , ere the plumes ,

that mark'd the better <unk> , might <unk> again .

" <unk> , with more his belly <unk> , comes .

on <unk> mountains 'midst the <unk> white ,

where <unk> <unk> hind , who <unk> beneath ,

a cavern was his dwelling , whence the stars

and main - sea wide in <unk> view he held .

" the next , whose loosen'd tresses <unk>

her bosom , which thou seest not ( for each hair

on that side grows ) was <unk> , she who search'd

through many regions , and at length her seat

fix'd in my native land , whence a short space

my words <unk> thy <unk> . when her sire

from life departed , and in <unk>

the city <unk> to <unk> mourn'd ,

long time she went a <unk> through the world .

aloft in <unk> <unk> land

a lake there lies , at foot of that proud alp ,

that o'er the <unk> locks <unk> in ,

its name benacus , which a thousand <unk> ,

<unk> , and more , water between the vale

<unk> and <unk> and the height

of apennine remote . there is a spot

at midway of that lake , where he who bears

of <unk> flock the <unk> <unk> , with him

of <unk> , and the <unk> , might each

passing that way his <unk> give .

a <unk> of goodly site and strong

<unk> stands , to <unk> with front <unk>

the <unk> and <unk> , whence the shore

more slope each way descends . there , <unk>

<unk> bosom holds not , <unk> o'er

down falls , and winds a river flood beneath

through the green <unk> . soon as in his course

the steam makes head , benacus then no more

they call the name , but <unk> , till at last

reaching <unk> into po he falls .

not far his course hath run , when a wide <unk>

it <unk> , which <unk> as a marsh

it <unk> , <unk> in summer oft .

hence journeying , the savage <unk> saw

'midst of the fen a territory waste

and naked of inhabitants . to shun

all human <unk> , here she with her <unk>

<unk> her arts remain'd , and liv'd , and left

her body <unk> . <unk> the tribes ,

who round were scatter'd , gath'ring to that place

<unk> ; for its strength was great , <unk>

on all parts by the fen . on those dead bones

they rear'd themselves a city , for her sake ,

calling it mantua , who first chose the spot ,

nor ask'd another <unk> for the name ,

wherein more numerous the people dwelt ,

ere <unk> <unk> by deceit

was <unk> of <unk> . if thou hear

<unk> another origin assign'd

of that my country , i <unk> thee now ,

that falsehood none <unk> thee of the truth . "

i answer'd : " teacher , i <unk> thy words

so certain , that all else shall be to me

as <unk> <unk> life . but now of these ,

who here proceed , instruct me , if thou see

any that merit more <unk> note .

for <unk> is my mind alone intent . "

he straight replied : " that spirit , from whose cheek

the beard sweeps o'er his shoulders brown , what time

<unk> was <unk> of her males , that scarce

the <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> was he

in <unk> , who with <unk> gave the sign

when first to <unk> the <unk> . him they nam'd

<unk> : so <unk> my <unk> strain ,

in which <unk> measure well thou know'st ,

who know'st it all . that other , round the loins

so <unk> of his shape , was <unk> <unk> ,

practis'd in <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .

" guido <unk> see : <unk> mark ,

who now were willing , he had <unk> still

the <unk> and <unk> ; and too late <unk> .

" see next the wretches , who the <unk> left ,

the <unk> and the <unk> , and became

<unk> : <unk> <unk> they wrought

with images and <unk> . but onward now :

for now doth <unk> with fork of thorns <unk>

on either hemisphere , touching the wave

beneath the towers of seville . <unk>

the moon was round . thou mayst remember well :

for she good <unk> did thee in the gloom

of the deep wood . " this said , both onward mov'd .

thus we from bridge to bridge , with other talk ,

the which my <unk> <unk> not to <unk> ,

pass'd on ; and to the summit reaching , stood

to view another <unk> , within the round

of malebolge , other <unk> pangs .

<unk> darkness <unk> o'er the place .

in the <unk> <unk> as <unk>

through wintry <unk> <unk> pitch , to <unk>

their <unk> vessels ; for th' <unk> time

sea - <unk> men <unk> , and in that while

his bark one <unk> <unk> , another stops

the <unk> of his , that hath made many a voyage ;

one <unk> at the prow , one at the poop ;

this <unk> oars , that other <unk> <unk> ,

the <unk> one <unk> and main - <unk> rent

so not by force of fire but art divine

<unk> here a <unk> thick mass , that round

<unk> all the shore beneath . i that beheld ,

but <unk> nought distinguish'd , save the <unk> ,

rais'd by the boiling , in one mighty <unk>

heave , and by turns <unk> and fall . while there

i fix'd my ken below , " mark ! mark ! " my guide

exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,

wherein i stood . i turn'd myself as one ,

impatient to behold that which beheld

he needs must shun , whom sudden fear <unk> ,

that he his flight delays not for the view .

behind me i discern'd a devil black ,

that running , up advanc'd along the rock .

ah ! what fierce cruelty his look bespake !

in act how bitter did he seem , with wings

<unk> outstretch'd and feet of <unk> tread !

his <unk> proudly eminent and sharp

was with a sinner <unk> ; by either haunch

he held him , the <unk> <unk> griping fast .

" ye of our bridge ! " he cried , " keen - <unk> fiends !

lo ! one of <unk> <unk> <unk> ! him

<unk> ye beneath , while i return for more .

that land hath store of such . all men are there ,

except <unk> , <unk> : of <unk>

for <unk> there an <unk> is quickly made . "

him dashing down , o'er the rough rock he turn'd ,

nor ever after <unk> a mastiff loos'd

sped with like eager haste . that other sank

and forthwith writing to the surface rose .

but those dark demons , <unk> by the bridge ,

cried " here the hallow'd visage saves not : here

is other swimming than in <unk> wave .

wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not ,

take heed thou mount not o'er the pitch . " this said ,

they grappled him with more than hundred hooks ,

and shouted : " cover'd thou must sport thee here ;

so , if thou canst , in secret mayst thou <unk> . "

e'en thus the <unk> <unk> him , with his <unk> ,

to thrust the flesh into the <unk> down

with flesh - hooks , that it <unk> not on the top .

me then my guide bespake : " lest they descry ,

that thou art here , behind a craggy rock

bend low and screen thee ; and whate'er of force

be offer'd me , or <unk> , fear thou not :

for i am well <unk> , who have been erst

in the like fray . " beyond the bridge's head

<unk> he pass'd , and reaching the sixth pier ,

behov'd him then a forehead terror - proof .

with storm and fury , as when dogs <unk> forth

upon the <unk> man's back , who suddenly

from whence he <unk> makes his <unk> ; so rush'd

those from beneath the arch , and against him

their weapons all they pointed . he aloud :

" be none of you <unk> : ere your time

<unk> <unk> me , come forth from amongst you one ,

" who having heard my words , <unk> he then

if he shall tear these limbs . " they shouted loud ,

" go , malacoda ! " whereat one advanc'd ,

the others standing firm , and as he came ,

" what may this turn avail him ? " he exclaim'd .

" believ'st thou , malacoda ! i had come

thus far from all your <unk> secure , "

my teacher <unk> , " without will divine

and destiny <unk> ? pass we then

for so heaven's pleasure is , that i should lead

another through this savage wilderness . "

forthwith so fell his pride , that he let drop

the <unk> of <unk> at his feet ,

and to the rest exclaim'd : " we have no power

to strike him . " then to me my guide : " o thou !

who on the bridge among the crags dost sit

low crouching , <unk> now to me return . "

i rose , and towards him <unk> with speed : the fiends

meantime all forward drew : me terror seiz'd

lest they should break the <unk> they had made .

thus issuing from <unk> , once i saw

th' <unk> <unk> , lest his <unk>

the foe should break ; so close he <unk> them round .

i to my leader's side <unk> , mine eyes

with <unk> and motionless <unk> bent

on their <unk> visage . they their hooks

<unk> , one the other thus bespake :

" <unk> thou i touch him on the <unk> ? " to whom

was answer'd : " even so ; nor miss thy <unk> . "

but he , who was in <unk> with my guide ,

turn'd rapid round , and thus the demon spake :

" stay , stay thee , <unk> ! " then to us

he added : " further <unk> to your step

this rock <unk> not , shiver'd to the base

of the sixth arch . but would you still proceed ,

up by this cavern go : not distant far ,

another rock will <unk> you passage safe .

<unk> , <unk> by five <unk> than now ,

<unk> hundred <unk> years and six had fill'd

the circuit of their course , since here the way

was broken . <unk> i straight <unk>

certain of these my <unk> , who shall <unk>

if any on the surface <unk> . with them

go ye : for ye shall find them <unk> fell .

come alichino forth , " with that he cried ,

" and calcabrina , and cagnazzo thou !

the troop of ten let barbariccia lead .

with libicocco draghinazzo haste ,

<unk> ciriatto , <unk> fierce ,

and farfarello , and mad rubicant .

search ye around the <unk> tar . for these ,

in safety lead them , where the other crag

<unk> <unk> the <unk> . "

i then : " o master ! what a sight is there !

ah ! without escort , journey we alone ,

which , if thou know the way , i <unk> not .

unless thy <unk> <unk> thee , dost not mark

how they do gnarl upon us , and their <unk>

<unk> us present tortures ? " he replied :

" i charge thee fear not : let them , as they will ,

gnarl on : 't is but in token of their <unk>

against the souls , who mourn in torment steep'd . "

to leftward o'er the pier they turn'd ; but each

had first between his teeth <unk> close the tongue ,

toward their leader for a signal looking ,

which he with sound <unk> <unk> gave .

it hath been heretofore my chance to see

<unk> with <unk> <unk> shifting <unk> ,

to <unk> <unk> , or in <unk> <unk> ,

or in <unk> <unk> outstretch'd for flight ;

light - <unk> <unk> and fleet <unk>

<unk> thy plains , <unk> ! have i seen ,

and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ,

now with the sound of <unk> , now of <unk> ,

<unk> , or <unk> made from <unk> <unk> ,

and with <unk> <unk> , our own ,

or <unk> from <unk> land ; but ne'er

to such a strange <unk> i beheld ,

in <unk> moving , horse nor foot ,

nor <unk> , that <unk> by sign from land or star .

with the ten demons on our way we went ;

ah <unk> company ! but in the church

with <unk> , with <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .

still earnest on the pitch i gaz'd , to mark

all things whate'er the chasm contain'd , and those

who burn'd within . as <unk> , that , in sign

to <unk> , heave high their <unk> <unk> ,

that thence <unk> they may <unk> to save

their <unk> vessels ; so , at <unk> ,

to <unk> the pain his back some sinner show'd ,

then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance .

e'en as the frogs , that of a <unk> moat

stand at the brink , with the jaws only out ,

their feet and of the trunk all else <unk> ,

thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon

as barbariccia was at hand , so they

drew back under the wave . i saw , and yet

my heart doth <unk> , one , that waited thus ,

as it <unk> that oft one frog remains ,

while the next springs away : and <unk> ,

who of the fiends was nearest , <unk> seiz'd

his <unk> locks , and dragg'd him <unk> up ,

that he appear'd to me an <unk> . each

already by their names i knew , so well

when they were chosen , i <unk> , and mark'd

how one the other call'd . " o rubicant !

see that his hide thou with thy talons <unk> , "

shouted together all the cursed crew .

then i : " inform thee , master ! if thou may ,

what wretched soul is this , on whom their hand

his foes have laid . " my leader to his side

<unk> , and whence he came inquir'd , to whom

was answer'd thus : " born in <unk> <unk>

my mother plac'd me in a <unk> <unk> ,

for she had borne me to a <unk> vile ,

a <unk> of his substance and himself .

the good king <unk> after that i serv'd ,

to <unk> here my thoughts were turn'd ,

whereof i give account in this dire heat . "

straight ciriatto , from whose mouth a <unk>

issued on either side , as from a boar ,

<unk> him with one of these . 'twixt evil claws

the mouse had fall'n : but barbariccia cried ,

<unk> him with both arms : " stand thou apart ,

while i do fix him on my prong transpierc'd . "

then added , turning to my guide his face ,

" inquire of him , if more thou wish to learn ,

ere he again be rent . " my leader thus :

" then tell us of the <unk> in thy guilt ;

knowest thou any sprung of latian land

under the tar ? " -- " i parted , " he replied ,

" but now from one , who <unk> not far thence ;

so were i under <unk> now with him !

nor hook nor <unk> then should <unk> me more . " -- .

" too long we suffer , " libicocco cried ,

then , <unk> forth a prong , seiz'd on his arm ,

and <unk> bore away the <unk> part .

him draghinazzo by his thighs beneath

would next have caught , whence <unk> their chief ,

turning on all sides round , with <unk> brow

restrain'd them . when their strife a little ceas'd ,

of him , who yet was <unk> on his wound ,

my teacher thus without delay inquir'd :

" who was the spirit , from whom by evil <unk>

<unk> , as thou has told , thou <unk> to shore ? " --

" it was the friar <unk> , " he rejoin'd ,

" he of <unk> , vessel of all guile ,

who had his master's <unk> in hand ,

and us'd them so that they commend him well .

<unk> he took , and them at large dismiss'd .

so he reports : and in each other charge

committed to his keeping , play'd the part

of barterer to the height : with him doth herd

the chief of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .

<unk> is a theme , whereof their tongue

is never weary . out ! alas ! behold

that other , how he <unk> ! more would i say ,

but tremble lest he <unk> to <unk> me sore . "

their <unk> then to farfarello turning ,

who roll'd his <unk> eyes in act to strike ,

<unk> him thus : " off ! cursed bird ! avaunt ! " --

" if ye desire to see or hear , " he thus

<unk> with dread resum'd , " or tuscan spirits

or lombard , i will cause them to appear .

meantime let these ill talons <unk> their fury ,

so that no vengeance they may fear from them ,

and i , remaining in this self - same place ,

will for myself but one , make <unk> appear ,

when my shrill <unk> shall be heard ; for so

our <unk> is to call each other up . "

cagnazzo at that word <unk> <unk> ,

then <unk> the head and spake : " hear his <unk> ,

<unk> as he is , to plunge him down . "

whereto he thus , who fail'd not in <unk> store

of <unk> - wove toils ; " <unk> <unk> extreme ,

<unk> only to <unk> myself more woe ! "

no longer alichino then <unk> ,

but thus , the rest <unk> , him bespake :

" if thou do cast thee down , i not on foot

will chase thee , but above the pitch will <unk>

my plumes . quit we the vantage ground , and let

the bank be as a <unk> , that we may see

if singly thou <unk> against us all . "

now , reader , of new sport expect to hear !

they each one turn'd his eyes to the' other shore ,

he first , who was the <unk> to <unk> .

the spirit of <unk> chose well his time ,

planted his feet on land , and at one leap

<unk> <unk> their <unk> .

them quick <unk> stung , but him the most ,

who was the cause of <unk> ; in pursuit

he therefore sped , exclaiming ; " thou art caught . "

but little it avail'd : terror <unk>

his following flight : the other <unk> beneath ,

and he with upward <unk> rais'd his breast :

e'en thus the water - <unk> , when she perceives

the falcon near , <unk> instant down , while he

<unk> and spent <unk> . that mockery

in calcabrina fury stirr'd , who flew

after him , with desire of strife inflam'd ;

and , for the barterer had 'scap'd , so turn'd

his talons on his <unk> . o'er the <unk>

in grapple close they join'd ; but the' other prov'd

a <unk> able to rend well his foe ;

and in the boiling lake both fell . the heat

was <unk> soon between them , but in vain

to <unk> themselves they strove , so fast were <unk>

their pennons . barbariccia , as the rest ,

that chance <unk> , four in flight <unk>

from the' other coast , with all their weapons arm'd .

they , to their <unk> on each side speedily

descending , stretch'd their hooks toward the fiends ,

who <unk> , inly burning from their <unk> :

and we departing left them to that <unk> .

in silence and in <unk> we went ,

one first , the other following his steps ,

as <unk> friars journeying on their road .

the present fray had turn'd my thoughts to <unk>

upon old <unk> <unk> , where he told

what fate unto the mouse and frog befell .

for language hath not sounds more like in sense ,

than are these chances , if the origin

and end of each be <unk> compar'd .

and as one thought <unk> from another forth ,

so afterward from that another sprang ,

which added doubly to my former fear .

for thus i <unk> : " these through us have been

so <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> so <unk> ,

as needs must sting them sore . if anger then

be to their evil will <unk> , more fell

they shall pursue us , than the savage <unk>

snatches the <unk> , <unk> 'twixt his jaws . "

already i perceiv'd my hair stand all

on end with terror , and look'd eager back .

" teacher , " i thus began , " if speedily

thyself and me thou hide not , much i dread

those evil talons . even now behind

they urge us : quick imagination works

so <unk> , that i already feel them . "

he answer'd : " were i form'd of <unk> <unk> ,

i should not sooner draw unto myself

thy outward image , than i now imprint

that from within . this moment came thy thoughts

<unk> before mine , with similar act

and count'nance similar , so that from both

i one <unk> have fram'd . if the right coast

incline so much , that we may thence descend

into the other chasm , we shall escape

secure from this <unk> pursuit . "

he had not spoke his purpose to the end ,

when i from far beheld them with spread wings

approach to take us . suddenly my guide

caught me , <unk> as a mother that from sleep

is by the noise <unk> , and near her sees

the <unk> <unk> , who snatches up her <unk>

and flies ne'er pausing , <unk> more of him

than of herself , that but a single <unk>

<unk> round her limbs . down from the <unk> <unk>

supine he cast him , to that pendent rock ,

which closes on one part the other chasm .

never ran water with such <unk> pace

<unk> the <unk> to turn a <unk> wheel ,

when nearest it approaches to the <unk> ,

as then along that edge my master ran ,

carrying me in his bosom , as a child ,

not a <unk> . scarcely had his feet

reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath ,

when over us the steep they reach'd ; but fear

in him was none ; for that high <unk> ,

which plac'd them <unk> of the fifth foss ,

power of departing thence took from them all .

there in the depth we saw a painted tribe ,

who pac'd with tardy steps around , and wept ,

faint in <unk> and <unk> with toil .

<unk> had they on , with <unk> , that fell low down

before their eyes , in fashion like to those

worn by the <unk> in <unk> . their <unk>

was <unk> with gold , dazzling to view ,

but leaden all within , and of such weight ,

that frederick's compar'd to these were <unk> .

oh , <unk> <unk> <unk> !

we yet once more with them together turn'd

to leftward , on their dismal <unk> intent .

but by the weight oppress'd , so slowly came

the fainting people , that our company

was chang'd at every <unk> of the step .

whence i my guide address'd : " see that thou find

some spirit , whose name may by his deeds be known ,

and to that end look round thee as thou go'st . "

then one , who understood the tuscan voice ,

cried after us aloud : " hold in your feet ,

ye who so swiftly speed through the <unk> air .

perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish . "

whereat my leader , turning , me bespake :

" pause , and then onward at their pace proceed . "

i <unk> , and saw two spirits in whose look

impatient <unk> of mind was mark'd

to <unk> me ; but the load they bare

and narrow path <unk> their approach .

soon as arriv'd , they with an eye askance

<unk> me , but spake not : then turning each

to other thus <unk> said : " this one

seems , by the <unk> of his throat , alive .

and , be they dead , what <unk> allows

they walk <unk> by the <unk> <unk> ? "

then thus to me : " tuscan , who <unk>

the <unk> of the mourning <unk> ,

disdain not to instruct us who thou art . "

" by arno's pleasant stream , " i thus replied ,

" in the great city i was <unk> and <unk> ,

and wear the body i have ever worn .

but who are ye , from whom such mighty grief ,

as now i witness , <unk> down your cheeks ?

what torment breaks forth in this bitter woe ? "

" our <unk> gleaming bright with <unk> hue , "

one of them answer'd , " are so leaden gross ,

that with their weight they make the <unk>

to <unk> beneath them . joyous friars we were ,

<unk> <unk> , catalano i ,

he <unk> nam'd , and by thy land

together taken , as men <unk> to take

a single and <unk> <unk> ,

to <unk> their <unk> . how there we sped ,

<unk> <unk> can best declare . "

" o friars ! " i began , " your <unk> -- "

but there brake off , for one had caught my eye ,

fix'd to a cross with three <unk> on the ground :

he , when he saw me , writh'd himself , throughout

distorted , <unk> with deep sighs his beard .

and catalano , who <unk> was <unk> ,

thus spake : " that pierced spirit , whom intent

thou <unk> , was he who gave the pharisees

counsel , that it were fitting for one man

to suffer for the people . he doth lie

<unk> ; nor any passes , but him first

behoves make <unk> trial how each <unk> .

in straits like this along the foss are plac'd

the father of his <unk> , and the rest

<unk> in that <unk> , seed of ill

and sorrow to the jews . " i noted then ,

how virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him ,

thus <unk> extended on the cross

in <unk> eternal . to the friar

he next his words address'd : " we pray ye tell ,

if so be lawful , whether on our right

lies any opening in the rock , whereby

we both may issue hence , without <unk>

on the dark angels , that compell'd they come

to lead us from this depth . " he thus replied :

" nearer than thou dost hope , there is a rock

from the next circle moving , which <unk>

each vale of horror , save that here his <unk>

is <unk> . by the ruin ye may mount :

for on the side it <unk> , and most the height

rises below . " with head bent down awhile

my leader stood , then spake : " he <unk> us ill ,

who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook . "

to whom the friar : at bologna erst

" i many <unk> of the devil heard ,

among the rest was said , <unk> is a <unk> ,

and the father of lies ! ' " when he had spoke ,

my leader with large <unk> proceeded on ,

somewhat <unk> with anger in his look .

i therefore left the spirits heavy <unk> ,

and following , his <unk> <unk> mark'd .

in the <unk> early <unk> , when the sun

<unk> his tresses in <unk> <unk> ,

and now towards equal day the <unk> <unk> ,

when as the <unk> upon the earth <unk> on

her dazzling sister's image , but not long

her milder sway endures , then <unk> up

the <unk> hind , whom fails his wintry store ,

and looking out beholds the plain around

all <unk> , whence <unk> he smites

his thighs , and to his <unk> returning in ,

there paces to and fro , wailing his lot ,

as a <unk> and helpless man ;

then comes he forth again , and feels new hope

spring in his bosom , <unk> e'en thus soon

the world hath chang'd its count'nance , <unk> his <unk> ,

and forth to <unk> drives his little flock :

so me my guide <unk> when i saw

his <unk> forehead , and so speedily

that ill was <unk> ; for at the fallen bridge

arriving , towards me with a look as sweet ,

he turn'd him back , as that i first beheld

at the steep mountain's foot . <unk> well

the ruin , and some counsel first maintain'd

with his own thought , he open'd wide his arm

and took me up . as one , who , while he works ,

<unk> his <unk> issue , that he seems

still to <unk> the' effect , so lifting me

up to the summit of one <unk> , he fix'd

his eye upon another . " grapple that , "

said he , " but first make proof , if it be such

as will sustain thee . " for one <unk> with lead

this were no journey . scarcely he , though light ,

and i , though onward push'd from crag to crag ,

could mount . and if the <unk> of this coast

were not less ample than the last , for him

i know not , but my strength had surely fail'd .

but malebolge all toward the mouth

inclining of the nethermost abyss ,

the site of every valley hence <unk> ,

that one side upward slope , the other fall .

at length the point of our descent we reach'd

from the last flag : soon as to that arriv'd ,

so was the breath <unk> from my <unk> ,

i could no further , but did seat me there .

" now needs thy best of man ; " so spake my guide :

" for not on <unk> plumes , nor under shade

of <unk> <unk> , fame is won ,

without which whosoe'er <unk> his days

<unk> such <unk> of himself on earth ,

as smoke in air or foam upon the wave .

thou therefore rise : vanish thy <unk>

by the <unk> <unk> , in each <unk> form'd

to vanquish , if she suffer not the weight

of her <unk> frame to <unk> her down .

a longer <unk> yet remains to <unk> .

from these to have escap'd <unk> not .

if well thou note me , profit by my words . "

i straightway rose , and show'd myself less spent

than i in truth did feel me . " on , " i cried ,

" for i am stout and fearless . " up the rock

our way we held , more rugged than before ,

<unk> and <unk> far to <unk> . from talk

i ceas'd not , as we journey'd , so to seem

least faint ; whereat a voice from the other foss

did issue forth , for utt'rance suited ill .

though on the arch that <unk> there i stood ,

what were the words i knew not , but who spake

seem'd mov'd in anger . down i <unk> to look ,

but my quick eye might <unk> not to the depth

for <unk> darkness ; wherefore thus i spake :

" to the next circle , teacher , bend thy steps ,

and from the wall <unk> we ; for as hence

i hear and understand not , so i see

beneath , and <unk> discern . " -- " i answer not , "

said he , " but by the deed . to fair request

silent performance <unk> best return . "

we from the bridge's head descended , where

to the eighth mound it joins , and then the chasm

opening to view , i saw a crowd within

of serpents terrible , so strange of shape

and hideous , that remembrance in my veins

yet <unk> the <unk> <unk> . of her <unk>

let <unk> <unk> no more : if <unk> ,

<unk> and <unk> be her brood ,

<unk> and <unk> , <unk> so dire

or in such <unk> swarming ne'er she shew'd ,

not with all <unk> , and whate'er

above the <unk> sea is <unk> .

amid this dread <unk> of woe

ran naked spirits <unk> with horrid fear ,

nor hope had they of <unk> where to hide ,

or <unk> to <unk> them out of view .

with serpents were their hands behind them bound ,

which through their reins <unk> the tail and head

twisted in <unk> before . and lo ! on one

near to our side , <unk> an adder up ,

and , where the neck is on the shoulders tied ,

transpierc'd him . far more quickly than e'er <unk>

<unk> o or i , he kindled , burn'd , and chang'd

to ashes , all pour'd out upon the earth .

when there <unk> he lay , the <unk> again

<unk> <unk> , and the self - same form

instant <unk> . so mighty sages tell ,

the' <unk> <unk> , when five hundred years

have well nigh <unk> , <unk> , and springs forthwith

<unk> . <unk> nor herb throughout his life

he <unk> , but tears of <unk> alone

and <unk> <unk> : <unk> of <unk>

and <unk> his funeral <unk> . as one that falls ,

he <unk> not how , by force demoniac dragg'd

to earth , or through <unk> <unk> up

in <unk> <unk> the powers of man ,

who , risen from his <unk> , <unk> around ,

<unk> with the <unk> agony

he hath <unk> , and <unk> <unk> sighs ;

so stood <unk> the sinner when he rose .

oh ! how severe god's judgment , that <unk> out

such blows in stormy vengeance ! who he was

my teacher next inquir'd , and thus in few

he answer'd : " <unk> <unk> am i call'd ,

not long since <unk> down from <unk>

to this dire <unk> . me the <unk> life

and not the human pleas'd , <unk> that i was ,

who in pistoia found my worthy <unk> . "

i then to virgil : " bid him <unk> not hence ,

and ask what crime did thrust him hither : once

a man i knew him <unk> and bloody . "

the sinner heard and feign'd not , but towards me

his mind <unk> and his face , wherein

was dismal shame <unk> , thus he spake :

" it grieves me more to have been caught by thee

in this sad plight , which thou beholdest , than

when i was taken from the other life .

i have no power permitted to <unk>

what thou <unk> . i am doom'd thus low

to dwell , for that the <unk> by me

was <unk> of its goodly <unk> ,

and with the guilt another <unk> <unk> .

but that thou mayst not joy to see me thus ,

so as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm

open thine ears and hear what i forebode .

reft of the <unk> first pistoia pines ,

then florence changeth citizens and laws .

from <unk> , drawn by <unk> <unk> ,

a vapour rises , wrapt in <unk> <unk> ,

and sharp and eager <unk> on the storm

with <unk> <unk> o'er <unk> field ,

whence suddenly the cloud shall burst , and strike

each helpless <unk> prostrate to the ground .

this have i told , that grief may rend thy heart . "

when he had spoke , the sinner rais'd his hands

pointed in mockery , and cried : " take them , god !

i level them at thee ! " from that day forth

the serpents were my <unk> ; for round his neck

one of then <unk> twisted , as it said ,

" be silent , tongue ! " another to his arms

<unk> , tied them , <unk> itself

so close , it took from them the power to move .

pistoia ! ah pistoia ! why dost doubt

to turn thee into ashes , <unk> earth

no longer , since in evil act so far

thou hast <unk> thy seed ? i did not mark ,

through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss ,

spirit , that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his god ,

not him , who headlong fell from thebes . he fled ,

nor utter'd more ; and after him there came

a centaur full of fury , <unk> , " where

where is the <unk> ? " on <unk> marsh

<unk> not the serpent tribe , as on his haunch

they <unk> , to where the human face <unk> .

behind his head upon the shoulders lay ,

with open wings , a <unk> <unk> fire

on <unk> he met . to me my guide :

" <unk> is this , who underneath the rock

of <unk> spread oft a lake of blood .

he , from his <unk> parted , here must tread

a different journey , for his <unk> theft

of the great herd , that near him <unk> ; whence found

his <unk> deeds their end , beneath the <unk>

of stout <unk> , that perchance laid on

a hundred blows , and not the <unk> was felt . "

while yet he spake , the centaur sped away :

and under us three spirits came , of whom

nor i nor he was ware , till they exclaim'd ;

" say who are ye ? " we then brake off discourse ,

intent on these alone . i knew them not ;

but , as it <unk> oft , befell , that one

had need to name another . " where , " said he ,

" doth <unk> <unk> ? " i , for a sign my guide

should stand attentive , plac'd against my lips

the finger lifted . if , o reader ! now

thou be not apt to <unk> what i tell ,

no <unk> ; for myself do scarce <unk>

the witness of mine eyes . but as i <unk>

toward them , lo ! a serpent with six feet

springs forth on one , and fastens full upon him :

his <unk> grasp'd the belly , a <unk>

seiz'd on each arm ( while deep in either cheek

he <unk> his fangs ) ; the hinder on the thighs

were spread , 'twixt which the tail <unk> <unk>

upon the reins behind . <unk> ne'er <unk>

a <unk> <unk> , as round the other's limbs

the hideous monster <unk> his own .

then , as they both had been of burning wax ,

each <unk> into other , <unk> <unk> ,

that which was either now was seen no more .

thus up the <unk> <unk> , ere it burns ,

a brown <unk> glides , not turning yet to black ,

and the clean white <unk> . the other two

look'd on exclaiming : " ah , how dost thou change ,

<unk> ! see ! thou art nor <unk> now ,

" nor only one . " the two heads now became

one , and two <unk> <unk> in one form

appear'd , where both were lost . of the four <unk>

two arms were made : the belly and the <unk>

the thighs and legs into such <unk> chang'd ,

as never eye hath seen . of former shape

all trace was vanish'd . two yet neither seem'd

that image <unk> , and so pass'd on

with tardy steps . as underneath the scourge

of the fierce dog - star , that lays bare the fields ,

shifting from brake to brake , the <unk> seems

a <unk> of lightning , if he <unk> the road ,

so toward th' <unk> of the other two

approaching seem'd , an adder all on fire ,

as the dark <unk> - grain , livid and <unk> .

in that part , whence our life is <unk> first ,

one he transpierc'd ; then down before him fell

stretch'd out . the pierced spirit look'd on him

but spake not ; <unk> stood motionless and <unk> ,

as if by sleep or <unk> fit assail'd .

he ey'd the serpent , and the serpent him .

one from the wound , the other from the mouth

breath'd a thick smoke , whose <unk> <unk> join'd .

lucan in mute <unk> now may hear ,

nor thy <unk> fate , <unk> ! tell ,

nor shine , <unk> ! <unk> now be mute .

what if in <unk> <unk> he record

<unk> and <unk> , to a <unk>

him chang'd , and her into a <unk> clear ,

i envy not ; for never face to face

two natures thus <unk> did he sing ,

wherein both <unk> were ready to <unk>

the other's substance . they in <unk> guise

so answer'd , that the serpent split his train

divided to a fork , and the pierc'd spirit

drew close his steps together , legs and thighs

<unk> , that no sign of <unk> soon

was <unk> : the tail disparted took

the <unk> which the spirit lost , its skin

<unk> , his <unk> to a <unk> .

the shoulders next i mark'd , that ent'ring join'd

the <unk> arm - <unk> , whose two <unk> feet

so <unk> , as the other's <unk> <unk> .

the feet behind then twisting up became

that part that man <unk> , which in the wretch

was <unk> in twain . while both the <unk> smoke

with a new colour veils , and <unk>

th' <unk> pile on one , <unk> it off

from th' other body , lo ! upon his feet

one upright rose , and prone the other fell .

not yet their <unk> and malignant <unk>

were <unk> , though each feature chang'd beneath .

of him who stood erect , the <unk> face

<unk> towards the temples , and what there

<unk> matter came , shot out in ears

from the <unk> cheeks , the rest , not backward dragg'd ,

of its excess did shape the <unk> ; and swell'd

into due <unk> <unk> the lips .

he , on the earth who lay , meanwhile <unk>

his sharpen'd visage , and draws down the ears

into the head , as doth the <unk> his horns .

his tongue <unk> before and apt

for utt'rance , <unk> ; and the other's fork

<unk> <unk> . that done the smoke was laid .

the soul , transform'd into the brute , glides off ,

<unk> along the vale , and after him

the other <unk> <unk> ; but soon turn'd

his new - <unk> shoulders on him , and in few

thus to another spake : " along this path

<unk> , as i have done , speed <unk> now ! "

so saw i <unk> in successive change

th' <unk> <unk> of the seventh hold :

and here if aught my tongue have <unk> , <unk>

so strange may be its <unk> . o'er mine eyes

<unk> hung , and on my thoughts amaze .

yet 'scap'd they not so <unk> , but well

i mark'd <unk> : he alone it was

of the three first that came , who chang'd not : thou ,

the other's fate , <unk> , still dost rue .

florence <unk> ! for thou so <unk>

hast <unk> , that o'er land and sea thy wings

thou <unk> , and thy name spreads over hell !

among the plund'rers such the three i found

thy citizens , whence shame to me thy son ,

and no proud honour to thyself <unk> .

but if our minds , when dreaming near the dawn ,

are of the truth <unk> , thou ere long

shalt feel what <unk> , ( not to say the rest )

would fain might come upon thee ; and that chance

were in good time , if it befell thee now .

would so it were , since it must needs befall !

for as time wears me , i shall <unk> the more .

we from the depth departed ; and my guide

<unk> <unk> the flinty steps , which late

we downward <unk> , and drew me up the steep .

pursuing thus our solitary way

among the crags and <unk> of the rock ,

sped not our feet without the help of hands .

then sorrow seiz'd me , which e'en now revives ,

as my thought turns again to what i saw ,

and , more than i am wont , i <unk> and <unk>

the powers of nature in me , lest they run

where virtue <unk> not ; that if aught of good

my gentle star , or <unk> better gave me ,

i envy not myself the <unk> <unk> .

as in that season , when the sun least veils

his face that <unk> all , what time the fly

gives way to the shrill <unk> , the <unk> then

upon some <unk> <unk> , beneath him sees

fire - flies <unk> <unk> o'er the vale ,

<unk> or <unk> , where his day - <unk> lies :

with flames so <unk> throughout its space

<unk> the eighth chasm , <unk> , when the depth

was to my view expos'd . as he , whose wrongs

the bears <unk> , at its <unk> saw

<unk> <unk> , when the <unk> erect

rais'd their steep flight for heav'n ; his eyes meanwhile ,

<unk> pursu'd them , till the flame alone

<unk> like a <unk> <unk> he kenn'd ;

e'en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,

a sinner so <unk> close in each ,

that none <unk> token of the theft .

upon the bridge i forward bent to look ,

and grasp'd a flinty mass , or else had fall'n ,

though push'd not from the height . the guide , who mark'd

how i did gaze attentive , thus began :

" within these <unk> are the spirits , each

<unk> in <unk> fire . " -- " master , thy word , "

i answer'd , " hath assur'd me ; yet i deem'd

already of the truth , already wish'd

to ask thee , who is in yon fire , that comes

so parted at the summit , as it seem'd

<unk> from that funeral pile , where lay

the theban brothers ? " he replied : " within

<unk> there and <unk> endure

their <unk> tortures , thus to vengeance now

together <unk> , as erewhile to wrath .

these in the flame with ceaseless <unk> deplore

the <unk> of the horse , that open'd wide

a portal for that goodly seed to pass ,

which <unk> <unk> rome ; nor less the guile

lament they , whence of her achilles <unk>

<unk> yet in death <unk> .

and there is rued the <unk> , that troy

of her <unk> <unk> . " -- " if they have power

of utt'rance from within these sparks , " said i ,

" o master ! think my prayer a thousand <unk>

in <unk> urg'd , that thou vouchsafe

to pause , till here the <unk> flame arrive .

see , how toward it with desire i bend . "

he thus : " thy prayer is worthy of much praise ,

and i <unk> it therefore : but do thou

thy tongue refrain : to question them be mine ,

for i divine thy wish : and they perchance ,

for they were <unk> , might shun discourse with thee . "

when there the flame had come , where time and place

seem'd fitting to my guide , he thus began :

" o ye , who dwell two spirits in one fire !

if living i of you did merit aught ,

whate'er the measure were of that desert ,

when in the world my lofty strain i pour'd ,

move ye not on , till one of you unfold

in what clime death <unk> him self - destroy'd . "

of the old flame forthwith the greater horn

began to roll , <unk> , as a fire

that <unk> with the wind , then to and fro

<unk> the top , as a tongue <unk> sounds ,

<unk> out its voice , and spake : " when i escap'd

from <unk> , who beyond a circling year

had held me near <unk> , by her charms ,

ere thus aeneas yet had nam'd the shore ,

nor <unk> for my son , nor reverence

of my old father , nor return of love ,

that should have crown'd <unk> with joy ,

could overcome in me the zeal i had

t' explore the world , and search the ways of life ,

man's evil and his virtue . forth i <unk>

into the deep <unk> main ,

with but one bark , and the small faithful band

that yet <unk> to me . as <unk> far ,

far as <unk> either shore i saw ,

and the <unk> and each isle beside

which round that ocean <unk> . tardy with age

were i and my companions , when we came

to the strait pass , where <unk> ordain'd

the <unk> not to be <unk> by man .

the walls of seville to my right i left ,

on the' other hand already <unk> past .

" o brothers ! " i began , " who to the west

through perils without number now have reach'd ,

to this the short remaining watch , that yet

our senses have to <unk> , <unk> not proof

of the <unk> world , following the track

of <unk> . call to mind from whence we sprang :

ye were not form'd to live the life of <unk>

but virtue to pursue and knowledge high .

with these few words i sharpen'd for the voyage

the mind of my associates , that i then

could scarcely have <unk> them . to the dawn

our poop we turn'd , and for the witless flight

made our oars wings , still <unk> on the left .

each star of the' other <unk> night now beheld ,

and ours so low , that from the ocean - <unk>

it rose not . five times re - illum'd , as oft

vanish'd the light from underneath the moon

since the deep way we enter'd , when from far

appear'd a mountain dim , <unk> methought

of all i e'er beheld . joy seiz'd us straight ,

but soon to mourning <unk> . from the new land

a whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side

did strike the vessel . <unk> it whirl'd her round

with all the waves , the fourth time lifted up

the poop , and sank the prow : so fate decreed :

and over us the <unk> billow clos'd . "

now upward rose the flame , and <unk> its light

to speak no more , and now pass'd on with leave

from the mild <unk> gain'd , when following came

another , from whose top a sound <unk> ,

forth issuing , drew our eyes that way to look .

as the <unk> bull , that <unk>

his cries first <unk> , who had shap'd its <unk> ,

did so <unk> , with the voice of him

tormented , that the <unk> monster seem'd

pierc'd through with pain ; thus while no way they found

nor <unk> <unk> through the flame ,

into its language turn'd the dismal words :

but soon as they had won their passage forth ,

up from the point , which <unk> <unk>

their motion at the tongue , these sounds we heard :

" o thou ! to whom i now direct my voice !

that lately didst <unk> in lombard phrase ,

" depart thou , i <unk> thee no more ,

though somewhat tardy i perchance arrive

let it not <unk> thee here to pause awhile ,

and with me parley : lo ! it <unk> not me

and yet i <unk> . if but e'en now thou fall

into this blind world , from that pleasant land

of <unk> , whence i draw my <unk> of guilt ,

tell me if those , who in romagna dwell ,

have peace or war . for of the mountains there

was i , betwixt <unk> and the height ,

whence <unk> first <unk> his mighty flood . "

leaning i listen'd yet with <unk> ear ,

when , as he touch'd my side , the leader thus :

" speak thou : he is a latian . " my reply

was ready , and i spake without delay :

" o spirit ! who art <unk> here below !

never was thy romagna without war

in her proud <unk> <unk> , nor is now :

but open war there left i none . the state ,

<unk> hath maintain'd this many a year ,

is <unk> . there <unk> eagle <unk> ,

and in his broad <unk> of <unk>

<unk> <unk> . the green talons grasp

the land , that stood erewhile the proof so long ,

and <unk> in bloody heap the <unk> of <unk> .

" the' old mastiff of <unk> and the young ,

that tore <unk> in their wrath , still make ,

where they are wont , an <unk> of their fangs .

" <unk> city and <unk> <unk>

under the lion of the <unk> <unk> .

<unk> <unk> ! that changeth sides ,

or ever summer <unk> to <unk> <unk> .

and she , whose <unk> is <unk> of <unk> wave ,

as 'twixt the level and the steep she lies ,

lives so 'twixt <unk> power and <unk> .

" now tell us , i entreat thee , who art thou ?

be not more hard than others . in the world ,

so may thy name still rear its forehead high . "

then <unk> awhile the fire , its sharpen'd point

on either side <unk> , and thus breath'd at last :

" if i did think , my answer were to one ,

who ever could return unto the world ,

this flame should rest <unk> . but since ne'er ,

if true be told me , any from this depth

has found his upward way , i answer thee ,

nor fear lest infamy record the words .

" a man of arms at first , i cloth'd me then

in good saint <unk> girdle , <unk> so

t' have made amends . and <unk> my hope

had fail'd not , but that he , whom <unk> light on ,

the' high priest again <unk> me into sin .

and how and wherefore listen while i tell .

long as this spirit mov'd the bones and <unk>

my mother gave me , less my deeds bespake

the nature of the lion than the <unk> .

all ways of <unk> <unk> i knew ,

and with such art conducted , that the sound

reach'd the world's limit . soon as to that part

of life i found me come , when each behoves

to lower sails and gather in the <unk> ;

that which before had <unk> me then i rued ,

and to repentance and <unk> turn'd ;

wretch that i was ! and well it had <unk> me !

the chief of the new pharisees meantime ,

<unk> his warfare near the <unk> ,

not with the <unk> or jews ( his foes

all <unk> were , nor against <unk> one

had fought , nor <unk> in the <unk> land ) ,

he his great charge nor sacred <unk>

in himself , <unk> , nor in me that cord ,

which us'd to mark with leanness whom it <unk> .

as in <unk> , constantine besought

to cure his <unk> <unk> aid ,

so me to cure the <unk> of his pride

this man besought : my counsel to that end

he ask'd : and i was silent : for his words

seem'd <unk> : but forthwith he thus resum'd :

<unk> thy heart <unk> fear : of all <unk>

i <unk> <unk> thee . in return ,

teach me my purpose so to <unk> ,

that <unk> <unk> earth no more .

heav'n , as thou knowest , i have power to <unk>

and open : and the keys are therefore twain ,

the which my <unk> meanly priz'd . ' "

then , yielding to the <unk> <unk> ,

of silence as more perilous i deem'd ,

and answer'd : " father ! since thou <unk> me

clear of that guilt wherein i now must fall ,

large <unk> with performance <unk> , be sure ,

shall make thee <unk> in thy lofty seat . "

" when i was <unk> with the dead , then came

saint <unk> for me ; but a <unk> dark

he met , who cried : <unk> me not ; he is mine ,

and must below to join the wretched crew ,

for the <unk> counsel which he gave .

e'er since i <unk> him , <unk> at his hair ,
